  - <b>USB Host specific</b>:
    - <b>changed source configuration files to headers</b> (USBH_Config_0..3.c -> USBH_Config_0..3.h).
    - <b>removed OHCI and EHCI drivers (moved to CMSIS-Driver pack)</b>.

The following sections show how to migrate projects from previous version of the MDK-Middleware (v7):
  - \ref usb_migration_component describes how to migrate the USB Component selection.
  - \ref usb_migration_config describes how to migrate the USB Component configuration.

\section usb_migration_component Component migration

To migrate the USB Component make the following changes to component selection:
  - <b>Keil::USB</b>: select <b>MDK</b> bundle instead MDK-Pro or MDK-Plus bundle.
  - <b>Keil::USB:CORE</b>: deselect <b>Debug</b> or <b>Release</b> variant if one was selected.

\note If the <b>Event Recorder</b> was used for debugging, please select the <b>Event Recorder</b>
      from the <b>CMSIS-View</b> pack instead the one from the <b>ARM_Compiler</b> pack.

\note USB Component requires C Compiler supporting C11 standard or higher

If any other component is used, like Network or File System, please refer to its Migration Guide.

\section usb_migration_config Configuration migration

Debug:
  - if the <b>USB_Debug.c</b> file exists, then compare it with the new <b>USB_Debug.h</b> file and copy
    old values into the new file:
    - if the old file does not exist then debugging was not configured previously
    - note that <b>USB Device Debug</b> and <b>USB Host Debug</b> order has swapped in the new configuration file.
    - \image html usb_debug_migrate.png "Old USB_Debug.c to new USB_Debug.h" width=90%

USB Device:
  - compare the existing <b>USBD_Config_0..3.c</b> files with the new <b>USBD_Config_0..3.h</b> files and copy
    old values into the new files:
    - \image html usbd_config_migrate.png "Old USBD_Config_0..3.c to new USBD_Config_0..3.h" width=90%

USB Host:
  - compare the existing <b>USBH_Config_0..3.c</b> files with the new <b>USBH_Config_0..3.h</b> files and copy
    old values into the new files:
    - the <b>USBH_Config_0..3.h</b> does not contain separate settings for <b>Custom</b>, <b>OHCI</b> or <b>EHCI</b>
      controllers anymore, so to migrate to the new configuration file note which <b>Controller Interface</b>
      was selected in the old <b>USBH_Config_0..3.c</b> file and copy appropriate controller's previous settings
      to the new configuration file.
    - for <b>Memory Pool Size</b> update the new value by <b>adding 128</b> since old setting did not include
      additional necessary space for memory pool internal operation.
    - \image html usbh_config_migrate.png "Old USBD_Config_0..3.c to new USBD_Config_0..3.h" width=90%

\note <b>OHCI</b> and <b>EHCI</b> drivers are not a part of the <b>MDK-Middleware</b> anymore but are distributed separately
      via the <b>CMSIS-Driver</b> pack, so please consult CMSIS-Driver documentation on configuring and using those drivers.
