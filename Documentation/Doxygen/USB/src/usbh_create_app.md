# Create an Application {#usbh_create_app}

The steps to create a microcontroller application that functions as an USB Host are:

-# Select \ref RTE_Software_Component_Selection_USBH "RTE Components" that are required for your application.
-# \ref USB_Driver_Configuration_USBH "Enable and configure the USB Host Driver".
-# Configure the \ref USB_Host_Configuration_USBH "USB Host" that connects the USB Middleware to the microcontroller USB
   peripheral.
-# Configure the \ref usbh_system_resources "System Resources" according to the USB Host component's
   \ref usbh_res_req "Resource Requirements".
-# Configure the parameters of the attached \ref USB_Device_Class_Configuration_USBH "USB Devices".
-# Implement the \ref USBH_User_Code_Implementation "Application Code" using code templates that are provided to support
   various USB Device Classes.
-# \ref usbh_debugging "Debug" you application using the built-in mechanisms of the USB Component.

## RTE Component Selection {#RTE_Software_Component_Selection_USBH}

Only a few steps are necessary to complete the RTE Component selection:

-# From the **USB** group:
  - Select **USB:CORE** component that provides the basic functionality required for USB communication.
  - Set **USB:Host** component instances to '1'. This creates one USB Host for communication with the attached USB Devices.
  - Select the desired USB Classes (HID/MSC/CDC/Custom Class) components.
    For example, select **USB:Host:HID** to support HID Class Devices only.
-# From the **CMSIS Driver** group:
  - Select an appropriate **USB Host driver** component suitable for your microcontroller.
-# From the **Device** group:
  - Select the target **microcontroller device** component.
  - Additional device specific driver components may be required according to the validation output.
-# From the **CMSIS** group:
  - Select the **CMSIS:CORE** component to provide the core interface to the processor.
  - Select a suitable **CMSIS:RTOS2** component that is required by the application.

## USB Driver and Controller {#USB_Driver_Configuration_USBH}

The USB Host Driver and the USB Controller of the microcontroller need to be correctly configured. In particular this means:

- The USB Host Driver selected under the Drivers Component is typically configured with a driver specific configuration header file.
  Some microcontrollers may require settings that related to a physical layer interface (**PHY**), the USB **VBUS** power and
  **Overcurrent** protection.
- The USB Controller of the microcontroller needs typically specific clock settings. Consult the user's guide of the microcontroller
  to understand the requirements. Alternatively you may copy the setup of a similar USB Host configuration provided for various evaluation boards (BSP).

## USB Host Configuration {#USB_Host_Configuration_USBH}

The **USBH_Config_n.h** file contains additional settings for the specific USB Host:

- The **Driver_USBH#** is set according to the selected USB Controller. For device with single USB Host Controller it will typically be '0'.
- **Port Power Delivery** can be configured according to hardware capability of the USB Host Controller.
- **Maximum Pipes** can be specified according to expected USB Device classes that are expected to be used by the USB Host.
- **Memory Pool** parameters can be configured that are necessary for USB Host operation.
  This memory pool can also be located to specific memory via the linker script.

Refer to \ref usbh_coreFunctions_conf for a detailed list of all available settings.

## System Resource Configuration {#usbh_system_resources}

For proper operation, the USB Host Component requires some system configuration settings. The requirements are:

- Additional **main stack size** of **512 bytes**.
- The USB Host Component uses CMSIS-RTOS2 threads.
  In case **RTX v5** is used **no changes to RTX settings** are necessary as all resources are allocated statically.

For more information, check the USB Host component's \ref usbh_res_req "Resource Requirements" section.
  
## Configuration of Attachable USB Devices {#USB_Device_Class_Configuration_USBH}

In the `USBH_Config_HID.h`, `USBH_Config_MSC.h`, `USBH_Config_CDC.h`, or `USBH_Config_CustomClass.h` you can specify the
number of concurrent USB Devices that the USB Host will support. This has an impact on the amount of memory that will be
reserved in your application for the attachment of USB Devices. The \ref usbh_examples shows how to configure an USB Host
to interact with different HID, MSC or CDC peripheral devices.

## User Code Implementation {#USBH_User_Code_Implementation}

\urlout{uv4_ca_sourcefiles} files provide function templates to support various USB Device Classes on the USB Host. The available functions are
explained in the \ref usbh_DevClassFunctions "Reference" section of the USB Host Component. These routines
can be adapted to the needs of the microcontroller application, in case different then default functionality is needed. 

The following templates are available for the USB Host component:

|Template Name           | Purpose|
|------------------------|--------|
|USBH_MSC.c              | Required functions to support MSC devices. The template can be found \ref USBH_MSC_UCT "here".|
|USBH_PL2303.c           | Required functions to support the [Prolific PL2303](https://www.prolific.com.tw/US/index.aspx) USB to serial RS232 adapter. The template can be found \ref USBH_PL2303_UCT "here".|
|USBH_User_CustomClass.c | Required functions to support any USB Device class. The template can be found \ref USBH_Cust_UCT "here".|

## Debugging {#usbh_debugging}

USB Host Component is distributed in a source form and it allows direct code debug.
Also debug events are available (via Event Recorder) which provide non-intrusive debugging during run-time.

`USB_Debug.h` configuration file is used to configure the level of debug events.

The \ref usbh_evr "USB Host:Debug Events" describes the events implemented in the USB Device Component.

### Event Recorder Support {#usbHostEvrSupport}

\urlout{Event-Recorder-About} is a powerful tool that provides visibility to the dynamic execution of the program.

The USB Host Component generates a broad set of \ref usbh_evr "Debug Events" for the Event Recorder and implements required infrastructure to interface with it.

To use the Event Recorder it is required to create an image with event generation support. The necessary steps are:

1. \urlout{Event-Recorder-Enable}: in the RTE management dialog enable the software component **CMSIS-View:Event Recorder**.
2. Ensure that Event Recorder is initialized preferably by \urlout{RTX5-Event-Recorder-Config} if CMSIS-RTOS2 RTX v5 is used,
   or alternatively by calling the function \urlout{Event-Recorder-Initialize-Func} in the application code.
3. \ref usbHostEvrConfig "Event Recorder Configuration": if necessary, adjust default Event Recorder configuration.
4. \ref usbHostDbgConfig "Configure Event Generation" in the `USB_Debug.h` configuration file.
5. Build the application code, download it to the target hardware and start debug session.

Now, when the USB Host generates event information, it can be viewed in the \urlout{uv4-Event-Recorder}.

### Event Recorder Configuration {#usbHostEvrConfig}

This section describes the configuration settings for the Event Recorder; refer to \urlout{RTX5-Event-Recorder-Config} for more information.

#### USB Event Generation Configuration {#usbHostDbgConfig}

Selecting the **USB:CORE** will add the file `USB_Debug.h` to your project. Use this file to set the event
generation configuration for USB core, drivers, and device classes separately. The file is common for USB Device and Host components.

![USB_Debug.h file for event generation configuration](USBH_USB_Debug_h.png)

The following settings are available for event generation configuration of each module:

- **Off** means no events will be generated by the module
- **Errors** means only error events will be generated by the module
- **Errors + API** means error and API call events will be generated by the module
- **All** means all available events will be generated by the module. Besides error and API call events, this contains operation and detailed events.

### Event IDs

The USB Host component uses the following event IDs:

| Component   | Event ID |
|-------------|----------|
| USBH_Core   | 0xB0     |
| USBH_Driver | 0xB1     |
| USBH_CC     | 0xB2     |
| USBH_CDC    | 0xB3     |
| USBH_HID    | 0xB4     |
| USBH_MSC    | 0xB5     |
