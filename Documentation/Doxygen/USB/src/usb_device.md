# USB Device {#USB_Device}

This chapter describes the software structure of the USB Device Component and its use for creating applications.
The USB Device Component simplifies the software development of microcontroller systems that interface to an 
USB Host.

**Attributes of the USB Device Component:**

- Supports \ref USB_Transfer_Rates "Low-Speed", \ref USB_Transfer_Rates "Full-Speed" and \ref USB_Transfer_Rates "High-Speed".
- Supports standard \ref USB_Classes "USB Classes" with multiple device class instances.
- Supports composite devices. Combine USB Device Classes to create a \ref dev_comp_tutorial "composite device".
- Supports multiple USB Devices on a single microcontroller with more than one USB Device controller.
- Provides \urlout{uv4_ca_sourcefiles} for implementing the USB Device functionality.
- Provides an user-friendly configuration file for each device class to generate \ref USB_Descriptors.
- Flexibly assigns \ref USB_Endpoints "USB Endpoints" to the microcontroller USB Device peripheral.
- Provides \ref USB_Device_Tutorial to show the use of the software stack.
  
For interfacing to an USB Host Computer, additional software may be required. Page \ref usb_sw_utilities shows an example
for such a software running on PCs with Microsoft Windows.

## RTE Components {#usbd_rte_components}

The picture shows the relationship between RTE Components and the microcontroller's USB Device peripheral (USB Controller).
RTE Components provide configuration files and user code templates.
**Configuration files** configure the RTE Components, hardware interfaces, memory resources and USB Device driver parameters. They
can have an impact on multiple RTE Components.
**User code templates** provide the skeleton for implementing the USB Device functionality.

The gray area around the RTE Components USB Device 1 and Driver_USBD1, as well as USB Controller 1 means that these components are optional
and can only be used if a microcontroller device has multiple USB controllers present. If this is the case, an USB Device
Class can be connected to any of the USB Device Instances.

  <div class="caption" style="text-align:center;">USB Device Structure</div>
</div>

USB Device peripherals can have one or more of the following USB Device Classes:

- \ref ADC "Audio Device Class (ADC)" is used to exchange streaming audio data between the USB Host and the USB Device.
- \ref CDC "Communication Device Class (CDC)" provides virtual communication port functionality to the USB Host.
- \ref HID "Human Interface Device (HID)" is typically used to implement a keyboard, joystick, or mouse. The
  HID Class can be also used for low bandwidth data exchange.
- \ref MSC "Mass Storage Class (MSC)" is used to connect various storage devices to an USB Host. Mass Storage Class media can be an SD card,
  internal or external Flash memory, or RAM.
- \ref CustomClass "Custom Class" is used to implement either a standard or a vendor specific USB Device Class.

Generic information about USB Device Classes can be found on the USB-IF's
[Approved Class Specification Documents](https://www.usb.org/documents?search=&category%5B%5D=49&type%5B%5D=55&items_per_page=50)
page.

Multiple RTE Component instances can interface with more than one USB Controller or can implement multiple
USB Device Classes. RTE Component instances are numbered. The number is appended to the RTE Component name, related configuration files,
and user code templates. Each RTE Component has a separate configuration file. For example, for HID 0 and HID 1
the configuration files have the name `USB_Config_HID_0.h` and `USB_Config_HID_1.h`.
\note The default configuration settings are pre-configured for one instance of an USB Device or USB Device Class
in a non-composite device peripheral. For other combinations the settings *need* to be edited to ensure proper
operation. The \ref dev_comp_tutorial example shows how to implement and configure a composite devices 

## Create an Application {#Creation_Steps}

The steps to create a microcontroller application that uses USB communication with an USB Device controller are:

-# Select \ref RTE_Software_Component_Selection "RTE Components" along with the USB Device Classes that are
   required for your application.
-# \ref USB_Driver_Configuration "Enable and configure the USB Device Driver".
-# Configure the \ref USB_Device_Configuration "USB Device" that connects the USB Middleware to the microcontroller USB peripheral.
-# Configure \ref USB_Device_Class_Configuration for each selected USB Device Class and instance.
-# Configure the \ref usbd_system_resources "System Resources" according to the USB Device component's
   \ref usbd_res_req "Resource Requirements".
-# Implement the \ref User_Code_Implementation "Application Code" using code templates that are provided for the USB Device
   Classes.
-# If required by your application, you can \ref Overriding_Descriptors "change the default USB Device descriptors".
-# \ref usbd_debugging "Debug" you application using the built-in mechanisms of the USB Component.

For interfacing to an USB Host computer, standard USB Device Classes drivers can be used. This may require additional software
development for the USB Host application. An exemplary application for interfacing to an USB HID Device is explained
\ref hid_client_app "here".
  
### RTE Component Selection {#RTE_Software_Component_Selection}

Only a few steps are necessary to complete the RTE Component selection:

-# From the USB Component:
  - Select **USB:CORE** that provides the basic functionality required for USB communication.
  - Set **USB:Device** to '1'. This creates one USB Device for communication with the USB Host.
  - Select the desired USB Classes (HID, MSC, CDC, ADC, or Custom Class).  For example, set **USB:Device:HID** to '1' to create a single HID Class Device. If
    you select more than one class or multiple instances of the same class on the same device, you will create a **Composite USB Device**.
-# From the Drivers Component:
  - Select an appropriate USB Device driver suitable for your application.
-# From the Device Component:
  - Additional device specific drivers may be required according to the validation output.
-# From the CMSIS Component:
  - Select the **CMSIS:CORE** to provide the core interface to the processor.
  - Select a suitable **CMSIS:RTOS2** that is a required for the application.

<div>
  <img style="text-align:left;" src="rteusbx.png"/>
  <div class="caption" style="text-align:center;">RTE Component Selection</div>
</div>

\note
- Most microcontrollers have only one USB Controller implemented in hardware and only one driver **Driver_USBD0**
  is available. In this case, only one **USB:Device** can be selected to generate **USB Device 0**.
- On a single **USB Device 0** an USB Composite Device may be implemented that combines multiple USB Device Classes.
- When a microcontroller implements multiple USB Controllers an additional **USB Device 1** can be generated by
  setting **USB:Device** to '2'.

### USB Driver and Controller {#USB_Driver_Configuration}

The USB Device Driver and the USB Controller of the microcontroller need to be correctly configured. In particular this means:

- The USB Device Driver selected under the Drivers Component is typically configured with a driver specific configuration header file.
  Some microcontrollers may require settings that are related to a physical layer interface **(PHY)**. The picture below shows two possible
  variants. Either, the USB PHY is integrated into the controller, or an external chip is used for providing the USB signal lines:

   ![USB Controller and PHY Setups](usb_phy.png)

- The USB Controller of the microcontroller typically needs specific clock settings. Consult the user's guide of the microcontroller
  to understand the requirements. Alternatively, you may copy the setup of an USB Device example (in case your hardware setup is
  similar to that of the chosen evaluation boards).

### USB Device Configuration {#USB_Device_Configuration}

The configuration file **USBD_Config_n.h** is listed in the Project Windows under the Component USB and 
contains a number of important settings for the specific USB Device.

- The **Driver_USBD#** number is set according to the selected USB Controller. This specifies which driver will be used for
  the USB Device determining the pin-out as well. For devices with single USB Device Controller it will typically be '0'.
- **High-Speed** may be selected if supported by the USB Controller.
- The **Vendor ID** (VID) needs to be set to a private VID. The default Vendor ID is owned by Keil and must not be used
  for actual products. Please visit [USB-IF](https://www.usb.org/getting-vendor-id)
  for more information on how to apply for a valid Vendor ID.
- Every device variant needs an unique **Product ID**. Together with the **Vendor ID**, it is used by the Host computer's operating system
  to find a driver for your device.
- The **Device Release Number** will be shown in Windows and Linux systems as “Firmware Revision”. The number will
  be interpreted as “binary coded decimal”, meaning that 0x0101 will be shown as firmware revision 1.01.
- The **Manufacturer**, **Product** and the **Serial Number String** can be set to identify the USB Device on the USB Host.

Refer to \ref usbd_coreFunctions_conf "USB Core Configuration" for more configuration options of the USB Device.

\note You can configure the USB Device at run-time using the functions from the
\ref usbd_coreFunctions_api "USB Device Core API". The section \ref usbd_coreFunctions "USB Device Core" explains the
details. Implement the run-time specific behavior with the user code template
\ref USBD_User_Device_UCT "USBD_User_Device_n.c".

### USB Device Class Configuration and USB Endpoint Settings {#USB_Device_Class_Configuration}

The USB Device Class Parameters and Endpoint Settings are configured in separate files for each USB Device Class and separately
for each instance. The configuration files contain Device Class specific Endpoint Settings Numbers and are listed in the
Project Window under the Component USB.

- **USBD_Config_ADC_n.h** configuration for Audio Device Class (ADC).
- **USBD_Config_CDC_n.h** configuration for Communication Device Class (CDC).
- **USBD_Config_HID_n.h** configuration for Human Interface Device Class (HID).
- **USBD_Config_MSC_n.h** configuration for Mass Storage Device Class (MSC).
- **USBD_Config_CustomClass_n.h** configuration for Custom Class.

Each \ref USB_Endpoints "USB Endpoint" can only be used once on the same USB Device. It has to be made sure that the different USB Device Classes 
or multiple instances of the same USB Device Class use different Endpoints. The default configuration supports applications that use a single USB Device Class.
The remaining parameters are specific settings that configure parameters for USB communication speed and the USB Device Class.

### System Resource Configuration {#usbd_system_resources}

For proper operation, the USB Device Component requires some system configuration settings. The requirements are:

- Additional **main stack size** of **512 bytes**.
- The USB Device Component uses CMSIS-RTOS2 threads.
  In case **RTX v5** is used **no changes to RTX settings** are necessary as all resources are allocated statically.

For more information, check the USB Device component's \ref usbd_res_req "Resource Requirements" section.

### User Code Implementation {#User_Code_Implementation}

\urlout{uv4_ca_sourcefiles} files provide function templates used to implement USB Device Class functionality. The available functions are
explained in the \ref usbd_DevClassFunctions "Reference" section of the USB Component. These routines
can be adapted to the needs of the microcontroller application, in case different then default functionality is needed. 

The following templates are available for the USB Device component:

|Template Name                                                             | Purpose|

### Changing Default USB Descriptors {#Overriding_Descriptors}

If there are different requirements regarding the \ref USB_Descriptors than the USB Component allows, a user can change any
or all of the default USB descriptors. Default descriptors are the ones that library creates based on
\ref USB_Device_Configuration "Device" and \ref USB_Device_Class_Configuration "Classes" configuration file settings and are
located in code memory.

The descriptors can be changed in two of the following ways:

#### Static change

Static change of descriptors can be done to replace default descriptors if they will not change at runtime. The descriptors
can be easily overridden by user code by creating descriptors with the same name.

| USB Device Descriptor                                    | Purpose
|----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------
| `const uint8_t usbdn_ep0_descriptor[]`                   | Control Endpoint 0 descriptor
| `const uint8_t usbdn_device_descriptor[]`                | USB Device descriptor
| `const uint8_t usbdn_config_descriptor_fs[]`             | Configuration descriptor for low/full-speed
| `const uint8_t usbdn_config_descriptor_hs[]`             | Configuration descriptor for high-speed
| `const uint8_t usbdn_device_qualifier_fs[]`              | Device qualifier for low/full-speed
| `const uint8_t usbdn_device_qualifier_hs[]`              | Device qualifier for high-speed
| `const uint8_t usbdn_other_speed_config_descriptor_fs[]` | Other speed configuration descriptor for low/full-speed
| `const uint8_t usbdn_other_speed_config_descriptor_hs[]` | Other speed configuration descriptor for high-speed

\note `n` in `usbdn_` represents the USB Device instance. So for the USB Device 0 instance, you have to use `usbd0_...`

\note String descriptor cannot be replaced this way.

**Code Example**

```c
// Statically change USB Device 0 Device Descriptor
const uint8_t usbd0_device_descriptor[] = { 
  18U,         // bLength = 18 bytes
  1U,          // bDescriptorType = 1 = Device Descriptor Type
  0U,2U,       // bcdUSB = 2.00 (little-endian)
  0U,          // bDeviceClass = 0 = Defined in interface
  0U,          // bDeviceSubClass = 0 = Defined in interface
  0U,          // bDeviceProtocol = 0 = Defined in interface
  64U,         // bMaxPacketSize = 64
  0x51U,0xC2U, // idVendor = 0xC251 (little-endian)
  0x34U,0x12U, // idProduct = 0x1234 (little-endian)
  0U,1U,       // bcdDevice = 1.00 (little-endian)
  0U,          // iManufacturer = 0 = No Manufacturer string
  0U,          // iProduct = 0 = No Product string
  0U,          // iSerialNumber = 0 = No Serial Number string
  1U           // bNumConfigurations = 1 = 1 configuration
};
```

#### Dynamic change

Dynamic change of descriptors can be done to change descriptors at runtime. The `struct usbd_desc_t` contains the
required information. It is stored in RAM and contains pointers to the USB descriptors. If you change the pointers in the
structure to the point to the externally created ones, you can change the descriptors at runtime.

The actual variable names of the structures holding descriptor pointers are `usbdn_desc` (n indicating the USB Device instance number).
The following code example shows how to override the device descriptor for the **USB Device 0** (`usbd0_desc`):

**Code Example**

```c
// Dynamically change USB Device 0 Device Descriptor
const uint8_t dev0_device_descriptor[] = { 
  18U,         // bLength = 18 bytes
  1U,          // bDescriptorType = 1 = Device Descriptor Type
  0U,2U,       // bcdUSB = 2.00 (little-endian)
  0U,          // bDeviceClass = 0 = Defined in interface
  0U,          // bDeviceSubClass = 0 = Defined in interface
  0U,          // bDeviceProtocol = 0 = Defined in interface
  64U,         // bMaxPacketSize = 64
  0x51U,0xC2U, // idVendor = 0xC251 (little-endian)
  0x34U,0x12U, // idProduct = 0x1234 (little-endian)
  0U,1U,       // bcdDevice = 1.00 (little-endian)
  0U,          // iManufacturer = 0 = No Manufacturer string
  0U,          // iProduct = 0 = No Product string
  0U,          // iSerialNumber = 0 = No Serial Number string
  1U           // bNumConfigurations = 1 = 1 configuration
};

int main (void) {

...
  usbd0_desc.device_descriptor = dev0_device_descriptor;
...
 
}
```

\note For changing just serial number string use the \ref USBD_SetSerialNumber function.

\note For non high-speed capable device following descriptors are not important:
- \ref USB_Device_Qualifier_Descriptor for low/full-speed
- \ref USB_Device_Qualifier_Descriptor for high-speed
- \ref USB_Configuration_Descriptor for low/full-speed
- \ref USB_Configuration_Descriptor for high-speed
- Other speed \ref USB_Configuration_Descriptor for low/full-speed
- Other speed \ref USB_Configuration_Descriptor high-speed

### Debugging {#usbd_debugging}

USB Device Component is distributed in a source form and it allows direct code debug.
However, with breakpoint stopping the program execution the USB Device will usually malfunction as USB Host 
will not be able to properly enumerate the device or communicate with it thus causing communication timeouts and failures.
For such usage case a non-intrusive debug via the debug events is also provided (via Event Recorder).

`USB_Debug.h` configuration file is used to configure the level of debug events.

The \ref usbd_evr "USB Device:Debug Events" describes the events implemented in the USB Device Component.

#### Event Recorder Support {#usbDevEvrSupport}

\urlout{Event-Recorder-About} is a powerful tool that provides visibility to the dynamic execution of the program.

The USB Device Component generates \ref usbd_evr "a broad set of Debug Events" for the Event Recorder and implements required infrastructure to interface with it.

To use the Event Recorder it is required to create an image with event generation support. The necessary steps are:

1. \urlout{Event-Recorder-Enable}: in the RTE management dialog enable the software component **CMSIS-View:Event Recorder**.
2. Ensure that Event Recorder is initialized preferably by \urlout{RTX5-Event-Recorder-Config} if CMSIS-RTOS2 RTX v5 is used,
   or alternatively by calling the function \urlout{Event-Recorder-Initialize-Func} in the application code.
3. \ref usbDevEvrConfig "Event Recorder Configuration": if necessary, adjust default Event Recorder configuration.
4. Build the application code, download it to the target hardware and start debug session.

Now, when the USB Device generates event information, it can be viewed in the \urlout{uv4-Event-Recorder}.

#### Event Recorder Configuration {#usbDevEvrConfig}

This section describes the configuration settings for the Event Recorder; refer to \urlout{RTX5-Event-Recorder-Config} for more information.

**USB Event Generation Configuration**

Selecting the **USB:CORE** will add the file `USB_Debug.h` to your project. Use this file to set the event
generation configuration for USB core, drivers, and device classes separately. The file is available for USB Device and Host components.

![USB_Debug.h file for event generation configuration](USBD_USB_Debug_h.png)

The following settings are available for event generation configuration of each module:

- **Off** means no events will be generated by the module
- **Errors** means only error events will be generated by the module
- **Errors + API** means error and API call events will be generated by the module
- **All** means all available events will be generated by the module. Besides error and API call events, this contains operation and detailed events.

#### Event IDs

The USB Device component uses the following event IDs:

| Component   | Event ID |
|-------------|----------|
| USBD_Core   | 0xA0     |
| USBD_Driver | 0xA1     |
| USBD_CC     | 0xA2     |
| USBD_ADC    | 0xA3     |
| USBD_CDC    | 0xA4     |
| USBD_HID    | 0xA5     |
| USBD_MSC    | 0xA6     |

## Examples {#USB_Device_Tutorial}

![USB device virtual COM port example hardware setup](cdc_dev_example_setup.png)

The `Abstract.txt` file contained in the **Documentation** group of the **Project** window gives you more
information on the general setup and the available I/O on the development board.

#### Build the "USB Device Virtual COM" Project

Open the example project in MDK.

##### Source Files

- `VirtualCOM.c` contains the main C function that initializes the board hardware and the USB Device Component.
  Furthermore, it contains the code that exchanges the data internally between the USB and the UART port.
- The **USBD_User_CDC_0.c** is an adapted code template that implements all necessary file access functions.
  Refer to \ref usbd_cdcFunctions_acm for details about these template functions.

If you are using RTOS other than CMSIS-RTOS2 RTX5 for your project please make sure to satisfy \ref usbd_res_req.

You may now build and download the example project to the evaluation board using the µVision commands:

- **Project** --> **Build target (F7)**
- **Flash** --> **Download (F8)**

After these steps, the project should start executing on your evaluation kit.
In case of errors, refer to the Evaluation Board User's Guide for configuration information.

#### Using the "USB Device Virtual COM" Project

##### Hardware Setup

The setup of the Evaluation Board hardware is described in the `Abstract.txt` file.

- Verify all jumper settings on the target hardware.
- Connect the UART on the development board to your PC (you might need an USB to serial RS232 adapter). Use an USB cable to
  connect your development board to the Host PC and power up your board.
- The **Welcome to the Found New Hardware Wizard** appears. Installation of the driver is described in detail in the
  `Abstract.txt` file.

##### PC Software

The USB Device Virtual COM example can be tested on a Windows PC using a terminal emulation program. Since Hyperterminal
in not part of Windows any more, please download an appropriate program for this purpose (such as **PuTTY** for example).
Open the two COM ports "COMx" and "COMy". Any data from "COMx" will be echoed on "COMy" and visa versa:

![VCOM terminals](vcom_terminals.png)

**About Host PC driver for Microsoft Windows**

The example folder contains two files relevant for driver installation on the Microsoft Windows:

- Driver setup information file (xxx-vcom.inf) which is used to create a digitally signed driver catalog file (xxx-vcom.cat)
- Digitally signed driver catalog file (xxx-vcom.cat)

The driver files are provided as an example, the driver setup information file should be adapted and digitally signed driver catalog file
should be created from adapted driver setup information file.

Driver setup information file should be adapted in the following way:

- **c251** in Vendor ID **VID_c251** entries should be changed to the vendor ID number assigned to your company by the USB organization
  (c251 Vendor ID is reserved for Keil Software and should not be used)
- **xxxx** in Product ID **PID_xxxx** entries should be changed to the product ID as assigned by your company
- in **[DeviceList.xxx]** sections, entries not relevant for the device, should be removed or added as described below:
  - if device is pure CDC class device (**not composite**) then all entries ending with **&MI_xx should be removed**
  - if device is a **composite device** with one or more CDC class instances then entries **not ending**
    with **&MI_xx should be removed** and entries **ending** with **&MI_xx should exist**
    for each CDC class instance
    (example driver contains entries ending with &MI_00 and &MI_02 which are used for composite device containing
     two CDC class instances and each instance uses 2 interfaces where MI_00 describes first CDC instance and
     MI_02 entry describes second CDC instance)
- **[Strings]** section should be changed as desired

\note
- Vendor ID and Product ID are configured in the USBD_Config_n.h configuration file of the embedded application.
- For producing digitally signed driver catalog file please refer to Microsoft Windows documentation.

### USB Device Audio {#dev_adc_tutorial}

The Audio Device Class (ADC) is used to send or receive audio, voice, and other sound-related functionality. This example
demonstrates a **USB Audio Device** attached to the USB Host Computer to provide this capability.

The following picture shows an exemplary connection of the development board and the USB Host Computer. Using the USB
connection, the development board will play sound using its on-board speaker:

### Custom USB Device (WinUSB_Echo) {#dev_cc_tutorial}

Using the custom USB class, you can implement any USB device that is not covered by the other classes available in the
MDK Middleware. An example is available for various development boards that is implementing a custom class to work with the
Windows USB (WinUSB), a generic driver for USB devices for Microsoft Windows. The example demonstrates a WinUSB device that
contains Bulk IN and Bulk OUT endpoints. All data that the device receives on the Bulk OUT endpoint is echoed back on the
Bulk IN endpoint.

The following picture shows an exemplary connection of the development board and the Windows USB host computer. Using the
USB connection and WinUSB_Test.exe ("install_dir\ARM\PACK\Keil\Middleware\x.y.z\Utilities\WinUSB_Test" folder
(where "install_dir" refers to the installation directory of Arm Keil MDK, default "C:\Keil_v5") and x >= 7, y >= 5, z >= 0),
you can initiate. For more information, refer to \ref winusb_app.

![Hardware setup for WinUSB Custom Class example](cc_dev_example_setup.png)

![Bulk transfers in the WinUSB test app](WinUSB_Test_bulk_transfer.png)

**About Host PC driver for Microsoft Windows**

The example folder contains two files relevant for driver installation on the Microsoft Windows:

- Driver setup information file (xxx-winusb_echo.inf) which is used to create a digitally signed driver catalog file (xxx-winusb_echo.cat)
- Digitally signed driver catalog file (xxx-winusb_echo.cat)

The driver files are provided as an example, the driver setup information file should be adapted and digitally signed driver catalog file
should be created from adapted driver setup information file.

Driver setup information file should be adapted in the following way:

- **c251** in Vendor ID **VID_c251** entries should be changed to the vendor ID number assigned to your company by the USB organization
  (c251 Vendor ID is reserved for Keil Software and should not be used)
- **xxxx** in Product ID **PID_xxxx** entries should be changed to the product ID as assigned by your company
- **[DeviceList.xxx]** sections should be changed if device is a composite device in the following way:<br>
  instead of entries like: `%DeviceName0% = USB_Install, USB\VID_xxxx&PID_yyyy`
  entries describing each custom class instance should be added like: `%DeviceName0% = USB_Install, USB\VID_xxxx&PID_yyyy&MI_00`
  where two digit number after MI_ describes the starting interface of a custom class instance
- **[Strings]** section should be changed as desired

\note
- Vendor ID and Product ID are configured in the USBD_Config_n.h configuration file of the embedded application.
- For producing digitally signed driver catalog file please refer to Microsoft Windows documentation.

### USB Composite Device {#dev_comp_tutorial}

An USB Composite Device is a peripheral device that supports more than one device class. Many different devices are implemented
as composite devices. For example they consist of a certain device class, but also an USB disk that has all the necessary drivers
stored so that the device can be installed automatically, without the need to have access to a certain driver software.

In this example, we will implement a composite device that is made up of two devices that have been used in the previous tutorials.
We will have access to the development board's **buttons** (from the HID example) and the **SC card** (from the MSC example).

![USB composite device example hardware setup](comp_dev_example_setup.png )

#### Build the "USB Composite" Project

Open the \ref dev_msc_tutorial "MSC example project" in MDK. From the \ref dev_hid_tutorial "HID example project", copy HID.c
and USBD_User_HID.c and add them to the project. Open the **Manage Run-Time Environment** window. Add one USB:Device:HID component to the
project. After clicking OK, you will see that the USB Component in the Project window will have an additional entry:
USBD_Config_HID_0.h. As the HID example uses LEDs and push-buttons, you might need to add these **Board Support** related
items as well. Check the RTE Component selection of the HID example for further detail.

##### Source Files

Now we have two main functions in the project. We need to delete one of them. Open the MassStorage.c file. Copy the lines

```c
finit ("M0:");           /* Initialize SD Card 0 */
fmount("M0:");           /* Mount SD Card 0 */
```
to the HID.c file right before the lines
```c
USBD_Initialize    (0);
USBD_Connect       (0);
```
Insert
```c
#include "rl_fs.h
```

to the `#includes` at the beginning of the HID.c file. Afterwards, remove the MassStorage.c from your project.
Now you have only one main function left.

##### USB Device Configuration

Before running the program on the target hardware, you need to edit the USBD_Config_HID_0.h file. Open the file, switch to
the **Configuration Wizard** and go to the **Bulk Endpoint Settings**. As the file is generic and has no information
about other classes available in the project, the Endpoint 1 is configured for IN and OUT. This endpoint is already used
in the USBD_Config_MSC_0.h file. So change the number for IN and for OUT to '2'. This will make the HID Component use the
Endpoint 2 for data exchange with the USB Host and no conflicts will occur with the MSC class.

If you are using RTOS other than CMSIS-RTOS2 RTX5 for your project please make sure to satisfy \ref usbd_res_req.

You may now build and download the example project to the evaluation board using the µVision commands:

- **Project** --> **Build target (F7)**
- **Flash** --> **Download (F8)**

After these steps, the project should start executing on your evaluation kit.
In case of errors, refer to the Evaluation Board User's Guide for configuration information.

#### Using the "USB Composite" Project

##### Hardware Setup

The setup of the Evaluation Board hardware is described in the `Abstract.txt` file.

- Verify all jumper settings on the target hardware.
- Insert a SD card into the socket.
- Use an USB cable to connect your development board to the Host PC and power up your board.
- Wait for the driver installation on the PC to complete. First you will see "Installing device driver software" and after a
  successful installation "USB Input Device" and "Keil Disk 0 USB Device".

\note
If devices do not install correctly then probably device is using same Vendor ID and Product ID as some device
that was previously already installed. There are two possible solutions: either change Product ID in USBD_Config_0.h file
or uninstall previously installed device that uses same Vendor ID and Product ID.

##### PC Software

The HID part of this example can be tested on a Windows PC using the HIDClient.exe utility (located in
"C:\Keil\ARM\Utilities\HID_Client\Release"). The program runs stand-alone without installation.

Steps to check the USB communication using the client utility:

- Run "C:\Keil\ARM\Utilities\HID_Client\Release\HIDClient.exe".
- Select the **Keil USB Device** to establish the communication channel.
- Press buttons on the target hardware and/or use the check boxes in the HID Client to interact with the application.
  The Mass Storage part of this example can be tested on a Windows PC using the **Windows Explorer**.
- After a successful driver installation, the **AutoPlay** window appears.
- If you click on **Open folder to view files** Windows Explorer automatically starts with the drive opened.

### USB Mouse {#dev_mouse_tutorial}

The USB Mouse example application shows how to control the mouse pointer of a host PC with a microcontroller device using
USB Device HID.

The following picture shows an exemplary connection of the development board (in this case a
[MCBSTM32F400](https://www.keil.com/boards2/keil/mcbstm32f400/)) to a host PC.
Using the joystick on the development board you can move the mouse pointer on the screen. Pressing the joystick down will
issue a left-click action.

![USB device mouse example hardware setup](mouse_dev_example_setup.png)

#### Create the "USB Mouse" Project

In this example, we are using the [MCBSTM32F400](https://www.keil.com/boards2/keil/mcbstm32f400/) board with the STM32F407IGHx device.
Create a new project in MDK (Select Device **STMicroelectronics:STM32F4 Series: STM32F407:STM32F407IG:STM32F407IGHx**).
In the **Manage Run-Time Environment** window, select the following components:

- **Board Support:Joystick (API):Joystick**  (Variant **MCBSTM32F400**)
- **CMSIS:Core**
- **CMSIS:RTOS2 (API):Keil RTX5**
- **CMSIS Driver:USB Device (API):Full-speed**
- **Device:STM32Cube Framework (API):Classic**
- **USB:Device: 1**
- **USB:Device:HID:1**

Click the **Resolve** button and then **OK**.

Before continuing to add the required source code, you need to add a template file called **USBD_User_HID_Mouse_0.c**:

- Right-click on **Source Group 1** and select **Add New Item to Group 'Source Group 1'...**.
- Click on **User Code Template** and select the **USB Device HID Mouse** template.
- Click **Add** to copy the file **USBD_User_HID_Mouse_0.c** to the project.

##### Source Files

- Click on **New (Ctrl + N)** to create a new file.
- Save it (**File -> Save**) as **main.h**.
- Copy the following code into the main.h file and save it again:

Before building the project, you need to edit these configuration files (in Configuration Wizard view):

- Under **Device**, double-click **RTE_Device.h** and:
  - enable **I2C1 (Inter-integrated Circuit Interface 1) [Driver_I2C1]** (for the Joystick connected to I2C1) and:
    - set **I2C1_SCL Pin** to **PB8**
    - set **I2C1_SDA Pin** to **PB9**
  - enable **USB OTG Full-speed** and under it:
    - enable **Device [Driver_USBD0]**

- Under **USB**, double-click **USBD_Config_0.h** and under **USB Device 0:Device Settings** change:
  - set **Product ID** to **0x3502**

- Under **USB**, double-click **USBD_Config_HID_0.h** and under **USB Device: Human Interface Device class (HID) 0:Human Interface Device Class Settings** change:
  - set **Maximum Input Report Size (in bytes)** to **4** as this is the size of report that is sent for a mouse
    position change and button presses from the main function
  - enable **Use User Provided HID Report Descriptor** and:
    - set **User Provided HID Report Descriptor Size (in bytes)** to **52**

Before building and downloading the project to the target, make sure that the correct debugger is set in the **Options for
Target** dialog (ALT + F7). You may then build and download the example project to the evaluation board using the µVision
commands:

- **Project** --> **Build target (F7)**
- **Flash** --> **Download (F8)**
- **Debug** --> **Start/Stop Debug Session (Ctrl + F5)**
- **Debug** --> **Run (F5)**

After these steps, the project should start executing on your evaluation kit.
In case of errors, refer to the Evaluation Board User's Guide for configuration information.

#### Using the "USB Mouse" Project

##### Hardware Setup

- Verify all jumper settings on the target hardware.
- Connect the development board to a host PC attaching a Micro-USB cable to the **USBFS** port. Observe how it is
  recognized as a USB HID device with the mouse protocol:

![HID-compliant mouse properties](hid_compliant_mouse.png)

- Play around with the joystick and see how the mouse moves on the screen.

### Ethernet-over-USB (for Linux hosts) {#dev_cdc_ncm}

The Ethernet-over-USB example connects a computer via USB to a Cortex-M system that provides an Ethernet interface for
network connectivity. The Linux Kernel provides native support for the CDC (NCM) USB Device class. This example shows how to
connect a Ubuntu system via USB to an MCBSTM32F400 development board.

The following picture shows an exemplary connection of the development board (in this case a
[MCBSTM32F400](https://www.keil.com/boards2/keil/mcbstm32f400/)) to a host PC.

![USB device Ethernet-over-USB example hardware setup](eth_over_usb_example_setup.png)

#### Create the "Ethernet-over-USB" Project

In this example, we are using the [MCBSTM32F400](https://www.keil.com/boards2/keil/mcbstm32f400/) board with the STM32F407IGHx device.
Create a new project in MDK (Select Device **STMicroelectronics:STM32F4 Series: STM32F407:STM32F407IG:STM32F407IGHx**).
In the **Manage Run-Time Environment** window, select the following components:

- **CMSIS:Core**
- **CMSIS:RTOS2 (API):Keil RTX5**
- **CMSIS Driver:Ethernet MAC (API):Ethernet MAC**
- **CMSIS Driver:Ethernet PHY (API):KSZ8081RNA**
- **CMSIS Driver:USB Device (API):High-speed**
- **Device:STM32Cube Framework (API):Classic**
- **USB:Device: 1**
- **USB:Device:CDC:1**

Click the **Resolve** button and then **OK**.

Before continuing to add the required source code, you need to add a template file called **USBD_User_CDC_NCM_ETH_0.c**:

- Right-click on **Source Group 1** and select **Add New Item to Group 'Source Group 1'...**.
- Click on **User Code Template** and select the **USB Device CDC NCM Ethernet Bridge** template.
- Click **Add** to copy the file **USBD_User_CDC_NCM_ETH_0.c** to the project.

##### Source Files

- Click on **New (Ctrl + N)** to create a new file.
- Save it (**File -> Save**) as **main.h**.
- Copy the following code into the main.h file and save it again:

```c

Before building and downloading the project to the target, make sure that the correct debugger is set in the **Options for
Target** dialog (ALT + F7). You may then build and download the example project to the evaluation board using the µVision
commands:

- **Project** --> **Build target (F7)**
- **Flash** --> **Download (F8)**
- **Debug** --> ** Start/Stop Debug Session (Ctrl + F5)**
- **Debug** --> ** Run (F5)**

After these steps, the project should start executing on your evaluation kit.
In case of errors, refer to the Evaluation Board User's Guide for configuration information.

#### Using the "Ethernet-over-USB" Project

##### Hardware Setup

- Verify all jumper settings on the target hardware.
- Connect the development board to a host Linux PC (native or in a virtual machine) attaching a Micro-USB cable to
  the **USBHS** port and using an Ethernet cable to the **ETH** connector.
- Using a virtual machine, you need to connect to the VM:

![Attach USB Device to Virtual Machine](vbox_usb_attach.png)

- Within the Linux system (here Ubuntu), you should be able to see a wired Ethernet connection (with the MAC address
  1E:30:6C:A2:45:5E):

![Wired Ethernet Connection using the USB CDC NCM Device](ubuntu_ncm.png)

\note Set the MAC address in the USB CDC configuration file \ref usbd_cdcFunctions_ncm_conf "USBD_Config_CDC_0.h".

##### Troubleshooting

Especially when working with virtual machines, the USB connection is not passed onto the guest system properly. Then it can
help to restart the guest. Also, to make Ubuntu use the network adapter that you like, do the following:
In Ubuntu's search, enter "network". The **Network Connections** program will be available in the search results:

![Ubuntu network connections](ubuntu_network_connections.png)

Double-click to open and then mark the **Wired connection 1** and click **Edit**:

![Wired Ethernet connection](ubuntu_network_connections_wired1.png)

Select the MAC address of your Ethernet-over-USB device and press **Save** and **Close**:

![Changing the connection](ubuntu_network_connections_wired1_selection.png)

This should instruct Ubuntu to use your device for the network connection. Also, try to disconnect any other network adapter
from the virtual machine.

### USB Device RNDIS to Ethernet Bridge {#dev_cdc_acm_rndis_bridge}

The USB Device RNDIS to Ethernet Bridge example connects a Windows host via USB to a Cortex-M system that provides an
Ethernet interface for network connectivity.

The following picture shows an exemplary connection of the development board (in this case a
[MCB4300](https://www.keil.com/boards2/keil/mcb4300/)) to a host PC.

![USB device RNDIS-to-Ethernet bridge example hardware setup](usb_dev_rndis_eth_bridge.png )

The `Abstract.txt` file contained in the **Documentation** group of the **Project** window gives you more information on the
general setup.

#### Build the "RNDIS to Ethernet Bridge" project

Open the example project in MDK.

##### Source Files

- `main.c` contains the main C function that initializes the Keil RTX real-time operating system.
- `RNDIS.c` contains the app_main C function that initializes the GLCD and the USB Device Component.
- The files **USBD_User_CDC_ACM_RNDIS_ETH_0.c** implements the application specific functionality of the CDC ACM class
  using the RNDIS protocol and is used to implement a Network Interface Card (NIC) to Ethernet Bridge to the USB Host. Refer
  to \ref usbd_cdcFunctions_acm for details about these template functions.

If you are using RTOS other than CMSIS-RTOS2 RTX5 for your project please make sure to satisfy \ref usbd_res_req.

You may now build and download the example project to the development board using the µVision commands:

- **Project** --> **Build target (F7)**
- **Flash** --> **Download (F8)**

After these steps, the project should start executing on your development kit.
In case of errors, refer to the development board user's guide for configuration information.

#### Using the "RNDIS to Ethernet Bridge" Project

##### Hardware Setup

The setup of the development board hardware is described in the `Abstract.txt` file.

- Verify all jumper settings on the target hardware.
- Power your development board externally.
- Connect a USB cable between your development board and the host PC.
- You should see new "Ethernet" connection with a "Remote NDIS compatible device" in your network
  control panel:
  ![Control panel](usb_dev_rndis_eth_bridge_control_panel.png)
  if driver is not installed automatically please install driver from example folder.

**About Host PC driver for Microsoft Windows**

The example folder contains two files relevant for driver installation on the Microsoft Windows:

- Driver setup information file (xxx-rndis.inf) which is used to create a digitally signed driver catalog file (xxx-rndis.cat)
- Digitally signed driver catalog file (xxx-rndis.cat)

The driver files are provided as an example, the driver setup information file should be adapted and digitally signed driver catalog file
should be created from adapted driver setup information file.

Driver setup information file should be adapted in the following way:

- **c251** in Vendor ID **VID_c251** entries should be changed to the vendor ID number assigned to your company by the USB organization
  (c251 Vendor ID is reserved for Keil Software and should not be used)
- **xxxx** in Product ID **PID_xxxx** entries should be changed to the product ID as assigned by your company
- in **[DeviceList.xxx]** sections, entries not relevant for the device, should be removed or added as described below:
  - if device is pure RNDIS CDC class device (**not composite**) then all entries ending with **&MI_xx should be removed**
  - if device is a **composite device** with one or more RNDIS CDC class instances then entries **not ending**
    with **&MI_xx should be removed** and entries **ending** with **&MI_xx should exist**
    for each RNDIS CDC class instance
    (example driver contains entries ending with &MI_00 and &MI_02 which are used for composite device containing
     two RNDIS CDC class instances and each instance uses 2 interfaces where MI_00 describes first RNDIS instance and
     MI_02 entry describes second RNDIS CDC instance)
- **[Strings]** section should be changed as desired

\note Vendor ID and Product ID are configured in the USBD_Config_n.h configuration file of the embedded application.
\note For producing digitally signed driver catalog file please refer to Microsoft Windows documentation.

### USB Web Server (for Windows hosts) {#dev_cdc_acm_rndis}

This example does not work out-of-the-box. You need to copy a network example for your development board using Pack
Installer. Then, you need to change some settings and add user code, to be able to connect your network enabled device to a
Windows hosts using USB.

\note The following description is based on the HTTP Server for a MCB1800 development board.

The following picture shows an exemplary connection of the development board (in this case a

## USB Host Computer Applications {#usb_sw_utilities}

Most of the available USB Device Classes are directly supported in operating systems. There is no need to install a particular
driver on the USB Host Computer to connect to the USB Device peripheral.

Some software needs to be written for the USB Host Computer when USB Driver classes are used to provide application specific
functionality. For example, the USB HID Device Class may be used for generic data exchange. Therefore the data exchange
interface needs to be developed at the USB Host Computer.

Refer to the following web pages for more information on USB Host software development:

- [USB Serial Bus (USB)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/) for Microsoft Windows.
- [Linux USB Project](http://www.linux-usb.org/) for Linux based operating systems.
- [DriverKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/driverkit) for Apple OS.

### Software Utilities

The USB Component comes with a set of software utilities that you can use as templates to create your own programs for the
USB Host computer. The utilities are specific for the different USB Device Classes. These are the available utilities:

- The \ref hid_client_app  can be used to interact with an USB HID Device. You can toggle LEDs on the development board
  and check the state of the on-board push-buttons.
- The \ref winusb_app can be used to test the connection between the USB Host PC and the client device. This application
  uses WinUSB driver on the USB Host PC and demonstrates the basics of using the Microsoft Foundation Classes and can be
  used as a starting point for writing your application.

### HID Client {#hid_client_app}

If you are using the \ref dev_hid_tutorial code, there's a way to test the functionality of that code together with a
Windows PC. The `HIDClient.exe` utility is located in `install_dir\ARM\Utilities\HID_Client\Release` folder
(where `install_dir` refers to the installation directory of Arm Keil MDK, default `C:\Keil_v5`) and can run stand-alone
without the need to install the software. To check the client utility with your board, do the following:

-# Download the USB Device **HID** application to your board.
-# Verify all jumper settings on the board.
-# Connect the board to a Windows PC. The PC should recognize the HID device and install the correct driver automatically.
-# Run `HIDClient.exe`.
-# Select the **Device** to establish the communication channel.
-# Test the application by pressing the correct buttons (refer to the application's `Abstract.txt` file) on your development
   board and/or check the right boxes in the client application to see the LEDs flashing.

![HID Client test app](hid_client_test.png)

#### HID Client Source Code {#client_app_cpp}

The source code of the HID Client application is available in `install_dir\ARM\Utilities\HID_Client`. Visual Studio 2005 and 2010
based projects are available (`HIDClient.vproj`). The structure of the project is as follows:

  by the resource editor in this file.

##### Source Files

- `HID.cpp` contains the necessary functions that are used in this example application to communicate with an USB HID device.
  All available functions in Windows for HID interaction are explained here:
  <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/hid/introduction-to-hid-concepts" target=_blank>Introduction to HID Concepts</a>.
  The function:
  - `HID_Init` initializes the HID class to be used with the USB Host.
  - `HID_UnInit` de-initializes the HID class from the USB Host.
  - `HID_FindDevices` scans the USB Bus and lists all available HID devices for connection to the application. This
    information is obtained from the \ref USB_Device_Descriptor that is generated by the USB Component using the configuration
	  files.
  - `HID_GetName` evaluates the \ref prod_string "Product String" of the device to be shown in the drop down box
    of the application.
  - `HID_GetInputReportSize` extracts the value of `USBD_HIDn_IN_REPORT_MAX_SZ` as specified in the
    \ref usbd_hidFunctions_conf "USBD_Config_HID_n.h" file.

    \ref usbd_hidFunctions_conf "USBD_Config_HID_n.h" file.
  - `HID_GetFeatureReportSize` extracts the value of `USBD_HIDn_FEAT_REPORT_MAX_SZ` as specified in the
    \ref usbd_hidFunctions_conf "USBD_Config_HID_n.h" file.
  - `HID_Open` opens the device.
  - `HID_GetSelectedDevice` returns the selected device.
  - `HID_Close` closes the device.
  - `HID_Read` initiates a \ref USBD_HIDn_GetReport within the device to send data to the USB Host.
  - `HID_Write` triggers a \ref USBD_HIDn_SetReport within the device to read data sent from the USB Host.
  - `HID_GetFeature` and `HID_SetFeature` work on the USB HID Device's feature report (which is optional).
- `HIDClient.cpp` is the main application source file that contains the application class `CHIDClientApp`.
- `HIDClient.rc` is a listing of all of the Microsoft Windows resources that the program uses (located in the res subdirectory).
- `HIDClientDlg.cpp` implements the code of the client's dialog and calls the functions specified in `HID.cpp`. This is
  the actual place where the interaction between the USB Host and the USB Device is defined.

### WinUSB Test {#winusb_app}

If you are following the \ref dev_cc_tutorial tutorial, you can test the connection between your custom class USB device and
a Microsoft Windows PC with this application. The binary `WinUSB_Test.exe` (which does not require installation) is available in the
