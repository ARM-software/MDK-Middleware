### USB Device Audio {#dev_adc_tutorial}

The Audio Device Class (ADC) is used to send or receive audio, voice, and other sound-related functionality. This example
demonstrates a **USB Audio Device** attached to the USB Host Computer to provide this capability.

The following picture shows an exemplary connection of the development board and the USB Host Computer. Using the USB
connection, the development board will play sound using its on-board speaker:

![USB device audio example hardware setup](adc_dev_example_setup.png)

The `Abstract.txt` file contained in the **Documentation** group of the **Project** window gives you more information on the
general setup and the available I/O on the development board.

#### Build the "USB Device Audio" Project

Open the example project in MDK.

##### Source Files

- `Audio.c` contains the main C function that initializes the board hardware and the USB Device Component.
- The file **USBD_User_ADC_0.c** is an code template that needs to be adapted to board audio hardware. Refer to
  \ref usbd_adcFunctions for details about these template functions.

If you are using RTOS other than CMSIS-RTOS2 RTX5 for your project please make sure to satisfy \ref usbd_res_req.

You may now build and download the example project to the evaluation board using the µVision commands:

- **Project** --> **Build target (F7)**
- **Flash** --> **Download (F8)**

After these steps, the project should start executing on your evaluation kit.
In case of errors, refer to the Evaluation Board User's Guide for configuration information.

#### Using the "USB Device Audio" Project

##### Hardware Setup

The setup of the Evaluation Board hardware is described in the `Abstract.txt` file.

- Verify all jumper settings on the target hardware.
- Use a USB cable to connect your development board to the Host PC and power up your board.
- The **Welcome to the Found New Hardware Wizard** appears. Installation of the driver is described in detail in the
  `Abstract.txt` file.
- If detected correctly, you should be able to see the following message:

![Installation succeeded](adc_install_ok.png)

##### PC Software

Use any PC software that is capable of playing audio. Normally, the device that has been connected last will play the audio
data. If you do not hear any sound coming from the on-board speaker, check your system settings.

### Custom USB Device (WinUSB_Echo) {#dev_cc_tutorial}

Using the custom USB class, you can implement any USB device that is not covered by the other classes available in the
MDK Middleware. An example is available for various development boards that is implementing a custom class to work with the
Windows USB (WinUSB), a generic driver for USB devices for Microsoft Windows. The example demonstrates a WinUSB device that
contains Bulk IN and Bulk OUT endpoints. All data that the device receives on the Bulk OUT endpoint is echoed back on the
Bulk IN endpoint.

The following picture shows an exemplary connection of the development board and the Windows USB host computer. Using the
USB connection and WinUSB_Test.exe ("install_dir\ARM\PACK\Keil\Middleware\x.y.z\Utilities\WinUSB_Test" folder
(where "install_dir" refers to the installation directory of Arm Keil MDK, default "C:\Keil_v5") and x >= 7, y >= 5, z >= 0),
you can initiate. For more information, refer to \ref winusb_app.

![Hardware setup for WinUSB Custom Class example](cc_dev_example_setup.png)

The `Abstract.txt` file contained in the **Documentation** group of the **Project** window gives you more information on the general setup.

#### Build the "WinUSB_Echo" Project

Open the example project in MDK.

##### Source Files

- `main.c` contains the main C function that initializes the hardware.
- `WinUSB_Echo.c` contains the app_main C function that initializes USB Device Component.
- The files **USBD_User_CustomClass_0.c/USBD_User_CustomClass_1.c** are adapted code templates that implement all
  necessary functions. Refer to \ref usbd_classFunctions for details about these template functions.

If you are using RTOS other than CMSIS-RTOS2 RTX5 for your project please make sure to satisfy \ref usbd_res_req.

You may now build and download the example project to the evaluation board using the µVision commands:

- **Project** --> **Build target (F7)**
- **Flash** --> **Download (F8)**

After these steps, the project should start executing on your evaluation kit.
In case of errors, refer to the Evaluation Board User's Guide for configuration information.

#### Using the "WinUSB_Echo" Project

##### Hardware Setup

The setup of the evaluation board hardware is described in the `Abstract.txt` file.

- Verify all jumper settings on the target hardware.
- Use a USB cable to connect your development board to the host PC and power up your board.
- If you connect the device to a PC running Windows 8 or later, the device driver will be installed automatically. On Windows 7, you need to select a driver file that can be found in the project folder. For more information, refer to the `Abstract.txt` file in the µVision project.

##### PC Software

The example can be tested on a Windows PC using the WinUSB_Test.exe utility provided with MDK Middleware. The program runs stand-alone without installation. Simply run "install_dir\\ARM\PACK\Keil\MDK-Middleware\x.y.z\Utilities\WinUSB_Test\Release\WinUSB_Test.exe" application
(where x >= 7, y >= 5, z >= 0):

![Bulk transfers in the WinUSB test app](WinUSB_Test_bulk_transfer.png)

**About Host PC driver for Microsoft Windows**

The example folder contains two files relevant for driver installation on the Microsoft Windows:

- Driver setup information file (xxx-winusb_echo.inf) which is used to create a digitally signed driver catalog file (xxx-winusb_echo.cat)
- Digitally signed driver catalog file (xxx-winusb_echo.cat)

The driver files are provided as an example, the driver setup information file should be adapted and digitally signed driver catalog file
should be created from adapted driver setup information file.

Driver setup information file should be adapted in the following way:

- **c251** in Vendor ID **VID_c251** entries should be changed to the vendor ID number assigned to your company by the USB organization
  (c251 Vendor ID is reserved for Keil Software and should not be used)
- **xxxx** in Product ID **PID_xxxx** entries should be changed to the product ID as assigned by your company
- **[DeviceList.xxx]** sections should be changed if device is a composite device in the following way:<br>
  instead of entries like: `%DeviceName0% = USB_Install, USB\VID_xxxx&PID_yyyy`
  entries describing each custom class instance should be added like: `%DeviceName0% = USB_Install, USB\VID_xxxx&PID_yyyy&MI_00`
  where two digit number after MI_ describes the starting interface of a custom class instance
- **[Strings]** section should be changed as desired

\note
- Vendor ID and Product ID are configured in the USBD_Config_n.h configuration file of the embedded application.
- For producing digitally signed driver catalog file please refer to Microsoft Windows documentation.

### USB Composite Device {#dev_comp_tutorial}

An USB Composite Device is a peripheral device that supports more than one device class. Many different devices are implemented
as composite devices. For example they consist of a certain device class, but also an USB disk that has all the necessary drivers
stored so that the device can be installed automatically, without the need to have access to a certain driver software.

In this example, we will implement a composite device that is made up of two devices that have been used in the previous tutorials.
We will have access to the development board's **buttons** (from the HID example) and the **SC card** (from the MSC example).

![USB composite device example hardware setup](comp_dev_example_setup.png )

#### Build the "USB Composite" Project

Open the \ref dev_msc_tutorial "MSC example project" in MDK. From the \ref dev_hid_tutorial "HID example project", copy HID.c
and USBD_User_HID.c and add them to the project. Open the **Manage Run-Time Environment** window. Add one USB:Device:HID component to the
project. After clicking OK, you will see that the USB Component in the Project window will have an additional entry:
USBD_Config_HID_0.h. As the HID example uses LEDs and push-buttons, you might need to add these **Board Support** related
items as well. Check the RTE Component selection of the HID example for further detail.

##### Source Files

Now we have two main functions in the project. We need to delete one of them. Open the MassStorage.c file. Copy the lines

```c
finit ("M0:");           /* Initialize SD Card 0 */
fmount("M0:");           /* Mount SD Card 0 */
```
to the HID.c file right before the lines
```c
USBD_Initialize    (0);
USBD_Connect       (0);
```
Insert
```c
#include "rl_fs.h
```

to the `#includes` at the beginning of the HID.c file. Afterwards, remove the MassStorage.c from your project.
Now you have only one main function left.

##### USB Device Configuration

Before running the program on the target hardware, you need to edit the USBD_Config_HID_0.h file. Open the file, switch to
the **Configuration Wizard** and go to the **Bulk Endpoint Settings**. As the file is generic and has no information
about other classes available in the project, the Endpoint 1 is configured for IN and OUT. This endpoint is already used
in the USBD_Config_MSC_0.h file. So change the number for IN and for OUT to '2'. This will make the HID Component use the
Endpoint 2 for data exchange with the USB Host and no conflicts will occur with the MSC class.

If you are using RTOS other than CMSIS-RTOS2 RTX5 for your project please make sure to satisfy \ref usbd_res_req.

You may now build and download the example project to the evaluation board using the µVision commands:

- **Project** --> **Build target (F7)**
- **Flash** --> **Download (F8)**

After these steps, the project should start executing on your evaluation kit.
In case of errors, refer to the Evaluation Board User's Guide for configuration information.

#### Using the "USB Composite" Project

##### Hardware Setup

The setup of the Evaluation Board hardware is described in the `Abstract.txt` file.

- Verify all jumper settings on the target hardware.
- Insert a SD card into the socket.
- Use an USB cable to connect your development board to the Host PC and power up your board.
- Wait for the driver installation on the PC to complete. First you will see "Installing device driver software" and after a
  successful installation "USB Input Device" and "Keil Disk 0 USB Device".

\note
If devices do not install correctly then probably device is using same Vendor ID and Product ID as some device
that was previously already installed. There are two possible solutions: either change Product ID in USBD_Config_0.h file
or uninstall previously installed device that uses same Vendor ID and Product ID.

##### PC Software

The HID part of this example can be tested on a Windows PC using the HIDClient.exe utility (located in
"C:\Keil\ARM\Utilities\HID_Client\Release"). The program runs stand-alone without installation.

Steps to check the USB communication using the client utility:

- Run "C:\Keil\ARM\Utilities\HID_Client\Release\HIDClient.exe".
- Select the **Keil USB Device** to establish the communication channel.
- Press buttons on the target hardware and/or use the check boxes in the HID Client to interact with the application.
  The Mass Storage part of this example can be tested on a Windows PC using the **Windows Explorer**.
- After a successful driver installation, the **AutoPlay** window appears.
- If you click on **Open folder to view files** Windows Explorer automatically starts with the drive opened.

### USB Mouse {#dev_mouse_tutorial}

The USB Mouse example application shows how to control the mouse pointer of a host PC with a microcontroller device using
USB Device HID.

The following picture shows an exemplary connection of the development board (in this case a
[MCBSTM32F400](https://www.keil.com/boards2/keil/mcbstm32f400/)) to a host PC.
Using the joystick on the development board you can move the mouse pointer on the screen. Pressing the joystick down will
issue a left-click action.

![USB device mouse example hardware setup](mouse_dev_example_setup.png)

#### Create the "USB Mouse" Project

In this example, we are using the [MCBSTM32F400](https://www.keil.com/boards2/keil/mcbstm32f400/) board with the STM32F407IGHx device.
Create a new project in MDK (Select Device **STMicroelectronics:STM32F4 Series: STM32F407:STM32F407IG:STM32F407IGHx**).
In the **Manage Run-Time Environment** window, select the following components:

- **Board Support:Joystick (API):Joystick**  (Variant **MCBSTM32F400**)
- **CMSIS:Core**
- **CMSIS:RTOS2 (API):Keil RTX5**
- **CMSIS Driver:USB Device (API):Full-speed**
- **Device:STM32Cube Framework (API):Classic**
- **USB:Device: 1**
- **USB:Device:HID:1**

Click the **Resolve** button and then **OK**.

Before continuing to add the required source code, you need to add a template file called **USBD_User_HID_Mouse_0.c**:

- Right-click on **Source Group 1** and select **Add New Item to Group 'Source Group 1'...**.
- Click on **User Code Template** and select the **USB Device HID Mouse** template.
- Click **Add** to copy the file **USBD_User_HID_Mouse_0.c** to the project.

##### Source Files

- Click on **New (Ctrl + N)** to create a new file.
- Save it (**File -> Save**) as **main.h**.
- Copy the following code into the main.h file and save it again:

Before building the project, you need to edit these configuration files (in Configuration Wizard view):

- Under **Device**, double-click **RTE_Device.h** and:
  - enable **I2C1 (Inter-integrated Circuit Interface 1) [Driver_I2C1]** (for the Joystick connected to I2C1) and:
    - set **I2C1_SCL Pin** to **PB8**
    - set **I2C1_SDA Pin** to **PB9**
  - enable **USB OTG Full-speed** and under it:
    - enable **Device [Driver_USBD0]**

- Under **USB**, double-click **USBD_Config_0.h** and under **USB Device 0:Device Settings** change:
  - set **Product ID** to **0x3502**

- Under **USB**, double-click **USBD_Config_HID_0.h** and under **USB Device: Human Interface Device class (HID) 0:Human Interface Device Class Settings** change:
  - set **Maximum Input Report Size (in bytes)** to **4** as this is the size of report that is sent for a mouse
    position change and button presses from the main function
  - enable **Use User Provided HID Report Descriptor** and:
    - set **User Provided HID Report Descriptor Size (in bytes)** to **52**

Before building and downloading the project to the target, make sure that the correct debugger is set in the **Options for
Target** dialog (ALT + F7). You may then build and download the example project to the evaluation board using the µVision
commands:

- **Project** --> **Build target (F7)**
- **Flash** --> **Download (F8)**
- **Debug** --> **Start/Stop Debug Session (Ctrl + F5)**
- **Debug** --> **Run (F5)**

After these steps, the project should start executing on your evaluation kit.
In case of errors, refer to the Evaluation Board User's Guide for configuration information.

#### Using the "USB Mouse" Project

##### Hardware Setup

- Verify all jumper settings on the target hardware.
- Connect the development board to a host PC attaching a Micro-USB cable to the **USBFS** port. Observe how it is
  recognized as a USB HID device with the mouse protocol:

![HID-compliant mouse properties](hid_compliant_mouse.png)

- Play around with the joystick and see how the mouse moves on the screen.

### Ethernet-over-USB (for Linux hosts) {#dev_cdc_ncm}

The Ethernet-over-USB example connects a computer via USB to a Cortex-M system that provides an Ethernet interface for
network connectivity. The Linux Kernel provides native support for the CDC (NCM) USB Device class. This example shows how to
connect a Ubuntu system via USB to an MCBSTM32F400 development board.

The following picture shows an exemplary connection of the development board (in this case a
[MCBSTM32F400](https://www.keil.com/boards2/keil/mcbstm32f400/)) to a host PC.

![USB device Ethernet-over-USB example hardware setup](eth_over_usb_example_setup.png)

#### Create the "Ethernet-over-USB" Project

In this example, we are using the [MCBSTM32F400](https://www.keil.com/boards2/keil/mcbstm32f400/) board with the STM32F407IGHx device.
Create a new project in MDK (Select Device **STMicroelectronics:STM32F4 Series: STM32F407:STM32F407IG:STM32F407IGHx**).
In the **Manage Run-Time Environment** window, select the following components:

- **CMSIS:Core**
- **CMSIS:RTOS2 (API):Keil RTX5**
- **CMSIS Driver:Ethernet MAC (API):Ethernet MAC**
- **CMSIS Driver:Ethernet PHY (API):KSZ8081RNA**
- **CMSIS Driver:USB Device (API):High-speed**
- **Device:STM32Cube Framework (API):Classic**
- **USB:Device: 1**
- **USB:Device:CDC:1**

Click the **Resolve** button and then **OK**.

Before continuing to add the required source code, you need to add a template file called **USBD_User_CDC_NCM_ETH_0.c**:

- Right-click on **Source Group 1** and select **Add New Item to Group 'Source Group 1'...**.
- Click on **User Code Template** and select the **USB Device CDC NCM Ethernet Bridge** template.
- Click **Add** to copy the file **USBD_User_CDC_NCM_ETH_0.c** to the project.

##### Source Files

- Click on **New (Ctrl + N)** to create a new file.
- Save it (**File -> Save**) as **main.h**.
- Copy the following code into the main.h file and save it again:

```c

    - set **Product ID** to **0x3518**

- Under **USB**, double-click **USBD_Config_CDC_0.h** and under **USB Device: Communication Device Class (CDC) 0** change:
  - set **Communication Class Subclass** to **Network Control Model (NCM)**

In case of errors, refer to the Evaluation Board User's Guide for configuration information.

#### Using the "Ethernet-over-USB" Project

##### Hardware Setup

- Verify all jumper settings on the target hardware.
- Connect the development board to a host Linux PC (native or in a virtual machine) attaching a Micro-USB cable to
  the **USBHS** port and using an Ethernet cable to the **ETH** connector.
- Using a virtual machine, you need to connect to the VM:

![Attach USB Device to Virtual Machine](vbox_usb_attach.png)

- Within the Linux system (here Ubuntu), you should be able to see a wired Ethernet connection (with the MAC address
  1E:30:6C:A2:45:5E):

![Wired Ethernet Connection using the USB CDC NCM Device](ubuntu_ncm.png)

\note Set the MAC address in the USB CDC configuration file \ref usbd_cdcFunctions_ncm_conf "USBD_Config_CDC_0.h".

##### Troubleshooting

Especially when working with virtual machines, the USB connection is not passed onto the guest system properly. Then it can
help to restart the guest. Also, to make Ubuntu use the network adapter that you like, do the following:
In Ubuntu's search, enter "network". The **Network Connections** program will be available in the search results:

![Ubuntu network connections](ubuntu_network_connections.png)

Double-click to open and then mark the **Wired connection 1** and click **Edit**:

![Wired Ethernet connection](ubuntu_network_connections_wired1.png)

Select the MAC address of your Ethernet-over-USB device and press **Save** and **Close**:

![Changing the connection](ubuntu_network_connections_wired1_selection.png)

This should instruct Ubuntu to use your device for the network connection. Also, try to disconnect any other network adapter
from the virtual machine.

### USB Device RNDIS to Ethernet Bridge {#dev_cdc_acm_rndis_bridge}

The USB Device RNDIS to Ethernet Bridge example connects a Windows host via USB to a Cortex-M system that provides an
Ethernet interface for network connectivity.

The following picture shows an exemplary connection of the development board (in this case a
[MCB4300](https://www.keil.com/boards2/keil/mcb4300/)) to a host PC.

The `Abstract.txt` file contained in the **Documentation** group of the **Project** window gives you more information on the
general setup.

#### Build the "RNDIS to Ethernet Bridge" project

Open the example project in MDK.

##### Source Files

- `main.c` contains the main C function that initializes the Keil RTX real-time operating system.
- `RNDIS.c` contains the app_main C function that initializes the GLCD and the USB Device Component.
- The files **USBD_User_CDC_ACM_RNDIS_ETH_0.c** implements the application specific functionality of the CDC ACM class
  using the RNDIS protocol and is used to implement a Network Interface Card (NIC) to Ethernet Bridge to the USB Host. Refer
  to \ref usbd_cdcFunctions_acm for details about these template functions.

If you are using RTOS other than CMSIS-RTOS2 RTX5 for your project please make sure to satisfy \ref usbd_res_req.

You may now build and download the example project to the development board using the µVision commands:

- **Project** --> **Build target (F7)**
- **Flash** --> **Download (F8)**

After these steps, the project should start executing on your development kit.
In case of errors, refer to the development board user's guide for configuration information.

#### Using the "RNDIS to Ethernet Bridge" Project

##### Hardware Setup

The setup of the development board hardware is described in the `Abstract.txt` file.

- Verify all jumper settings on the target hardware.
- Power your development board externally.
- Connect a USB cable between your development board and the host PC.
- You should see new "Ethernet" connection with a "Remote NDIS compatible device" in your network
  control panel:
  ![Control panel](usb_dev_rndis_eth_bridge_control_panel.png)
  if driver is not installed automatically please install driver from example folder.

**About Host PC driver for Microsoft Windows**

The example folder contains two files relevant for driver installation on the Microsoft Windows:

- Driver setup information file (xxx-rndis.inf) which is used to create a digitally signed driver catalog file (xxx-rndis.cat)
- Digitally signed driver catalog file (xxx-rndis.cat)

The driver files are provided as an example, the driver setup information file should be adapted and digitally signed driver catalog file
should be created from adapted driver setup information file.

Driver setup information file should be adapted in the following way:

- **c251** in Vendor ID **VID_c251** entries should be changed to the vendor ID number assigned to your company by the USB organization
  (c251 Vendor ID is reserved for Keil Software and should not be used)
- **xxxx** in Product ID **PID_xxxx** entries should be changed to the product ID as assigned by your company
- in **[DeviceList.xxx]** sections, entries not relevant for the device, should be removed or added as described below:
  - if device is pure RNDIS CDC class device (**not composite**) then all entries ending with **&MI_xx should be removed**
  - if device is a **composite device** with one or more RNDIS CDC class instances then entries **not ending**
    with **&MI_xx should be removed** and entries **ending** with **&MI_xx should exist**
    for each RNDIS CDC class instance
    (example driver contains entries ending with &MI_00 and &MI_02 which are used for composite device containing
     two RNDIS CDC class instances and each instance uses 2 interfaces where MI_00 describes first RNDIS instance and
     MI_02 entry describes second RNDIS CDC instance)
- **[Strings]** section should be changed as desired

\note Vendor ID and Product ID are configured in the USBD_Config_n.h configuration file of the embedded application.
\note For producing digitally signed driver catalog file please refer to Microsoft Windows documentation.

### USB Web Server (for Windows hosts) {#dev_cdc_acm_rndis}

This example does not work out-of-the-box. You need to copy a network example for your development board using Pack
Installer. Then, you need to change some settings and add user code, to be able to connect your network enabled device to a
Windows hosts using USB.

\note The following description is based on the HTTP Server for a MCB1800 development board.

The following picture shows an exemplary connection of the development board (in this case a
[MCB1800](https://www.keil.com/boards2/keil/mcb1800/)) to a host PC.

![USB device web server example hardware setup](usb_web_server_example.png )

#### Create the "USB Web Server" project

- Copy the HTTP Server example using Pack Installer
- Change following settings in RTE:
  - Disable CMSIS Driver:Ethernet MAC (API)
  - Disable CMSIS Driver:Ethernet PHY (API)
  - Enable CMSIS Driver:Ethernet (API):RNDIS
  - Enable an appropriate CMSIS Driver:USB Device (API)
  - Set USB:Device = 1
  - Enable USB:CORE
  - Set USB:Device:CDC = 1
- Enable the selected USB port in RTE_Device.h or using external tools (for example STM32CubeMX for STMicroelectronics
   devices)
- Disable the Ethernet port in RTE_Device.h or using external tools (for example STM32CubeMX for STMicroelectronics
   devices)
- Add a user code template to your sources (right-click on Source group in Project window -> Add New Item to Group 'Source'
   -> User Code Template -> USB:USB Device:CDC: USB Device CDC ACM RNDIS Virtual Ethernet -> Add)
- Disable DHCP in network settings (open Network:Net_Config_ETH_0.h and disable Dynamic Host Configuration)
