# USB Host {#USB_Host}

This chapter describes the software structure of the USB Host Component and explains its use for creating an USB Host
application.

The USB Host Component simplifies software development of microcontroller systems that allow to connect USB Devices.
The attributes of the USB Host Component are:

- Complies with the USB 2.0 specification.
- Support for \ref HID "HID", \ref MSC "MSC", \ref CDC "CDC", and \ref CustomClass "Custom" USB Device Classes to be
  connected to the USB Host.
- Support for \ref USB_Control_Transfers "control", \ref USB_Interrupt_Transfers "interrupt" and \ref USB_Bulk_Transfers
  "bulk" transfer types.

## RTE Components {#usbh_rte_components}

The following picture shows the relationships of the RTE Components with the microcontroller's USB Host peripheral (USB
Controller). RTE Components provide configuration files and user code templates. **Configuration files** configure the RTE
Components, hardware interfaces, memory resources and USB Host parameters. **User code templates** provide the skeleton
for implementing support for different USB Device classes.

## Create an Application {#Create_a_USB_Host_Application}

The steps to create a microcontroller application that functions as an USB Host are:

-# Select \ref RTE_Software_Component_Selection_USBH "RTE Components" that are required for your application.
-# \ref USB_Driver_Configuration_USBH "Enable and configure the USB Host Driver".
-# Configure the \ref USB_Host_Configuration_USBH "USB Host" that connects the USB Middleware to the microcontroller USB
   peripheral.
-# Configure the \ref usbh_system_resources "System Resources" according to the USB Host component's
   \ref usbh_res_req "Resource Requirements".
-# Configure the parameters of the attached \ref USB_Device_Class_Configuration_USBH "USB Devices".
-# Implement the \ref USBH_User_Code_Implementation "Application Code" using code templates that are provided to support
   various USB Device Classes.
-# \ref usbh_debugging "Debug" you application using the built-in mechanisms of the USB Component.

### RTE Component Selection {#RTE_Software_Component_Selection_USBH}

The RTE Component selection is done in a few steps:

-# From the USB Component:
  - Select **USB:CORE** that provides the basic functionality required for USB communication.
  - Set **USB:Host** to '1'. This creates one USB Host for communication with attached USB Devices.
  - Select the desired support for USB Classes (HID/MSC/CDC/Custom Class). For example, select **USB:Host:HID**
    to support HID Class Devices only.
-# From the Drivers Component:
  - Select an appropriate USB Host driver suitable for your application.
-# From the Device Component:
  - Additional device specific drivers may be required according to the validation output.
-# From the CMSIS Component:
  - Select the **CMSIS:CORE** to provide the core interface to the processor.
  - Select a suitable **CMSIS:RTOS2** that is a required for the application.

  <div class="caption" style="text-align:center;">RTE Component Selection</div>
</div>

### USB Driver and Controller {#USB_Driver_Configuration_USBH}

The USB Host Driver and the USB Controller of the microcontroller need to be correctly configured. In particular this means:

- The USB Host Driver selected under the Drivers Component is typically configured with a driver specific configuration header file.
  Some microcontrollers may require settings that related to a physical layer interface (**PHY**), the USB **VBUS** power and
  **Overcurrent** protection.
- The USB Controller of the microcontroller needs typically specific clock settings. Consult the user's guide of the microcontroller
  to understand the requirements. Alternatively you may copy the setup of an USB Host example that is provided for various 
  evaluation boards.

### USB Host Configuration {#USB_Host_Configuration_USBH}

The **USBH_Config_n.h** file contains additional settings for the specific USB Host:

- The **Driver_USBH#** is set according to the selected USB Controller. For device with single USB Host Controller it will typically be '0'.
- **Port Power Delivery** can be configured according to hardware capability of the USB Host Controller.
- **Maximum Pipes** can be specified according to expected USB Device classes that are expected to be used by the USB Host.
- **Memory Pool** parameters can be configured that are necessary for USB Host operation.
  This memory pool can also be located to specific memory via the linker script.

Refer to \ref usbh_coreFunctions_conf for a detailed list of all available settings.

### System Resource Configuration {#usbh_system_resources}

For proper operation, the USB Host Component requires some system configuration settings. The requirements are:

- Additional **main stack size** of **512 bytes**.
- The USB Host Component uses CMSIS-RTOS2 threads.
  In case **RTX v5** is used **no changes to RTX settings** are necessary as all resources are allocated statically.

For more information, check the USB Host component's \ref usbh_res_req "Resource Requirements" section.
  
### Configuration of Attachable USB Devices {#USB_Device_Class_Configuration_USBH}

In the `USBH_Config_HID.h`, `USBH_Config_MSC.h`, `USBH_Config_CDC.h`, or `USBH_Config_CustomClass.h` you can specify the
number of concurrent USB Devices that the USB Host will support. This has an impact on the amount of memory that will be
reserved in your application for the attachment of USB Devices. The \ref USB_Host_Tutorial shows how to configure an USB Host
to interact with different HID, MSC or CDC peripheral devices.

### User Code Implementation {#USBH_User_Code_Implementation}

\urlout{uv4_ca_sourcefiles} files provide function templates to support various USB Device Classes on the USB Host. The available functions are
explained in the \ref usbh_DevClassFunctions "Reference" section of the USB Host Component. These routines
can be adapted to the needs of the microcontroller application, in case different then default functionality is needed. 

The following templates are available for the USB Host component:

|Template Name           | Purpose|
|------------------------|--------|
|USBH_MSC.c              | Required functions to support MSC devices. The template can be found \ref USBH_MSC_UCT "here".|
|USBH_PL2303.c           | Required functions to support the [Prolific PL2303](https://www.prolific.com.tw/US/index.aspx) USB to serial RS232 adapter. The template can be found \ref USBH_PL2303_UCT "here".|
|USBH_User_CustomClass.c | Required functions to support any USB Device class. The template can be found \ref USBH_Cust_UCT "here".|

### Debugging {#usbh_debugging}

USB Host Component is distributed in a source form and it allows direct code debug.
Also debug events are available (via Event Recorder) which provide non-intrusive debugging during runtime.

`USB_Debug.h` configuration file is used to configure the level of debug events.

The \ref usbh_evr "USB Host:Debug Events" describes the events implemented in the USB Device Component.

#### Event Recorder Support {#usbHostEvrSupport}

\urlout{Event-Recorder-About} is a powerful tool that provides visibility to the dynamic execution of the program.

The USB Host Component generates \ref usbh_evr "a broad set of Debug Events" for the Event Recorder and implements required infrastructure to interface with it.

To use the Event Recorder it is required to create an image with event generation support. The necessary steps are:

1. \urlout{Event-Recorder-Enable}: in the RTE management dialog enable the software component **CMSIS-View:Event Recorder**.
2. Ensure that Event Recorder is initialized preferably by \urlout{RTX5-Event-Recorder-Config} if CMSIS-RTOS2 RTX v5 is used,
   or alternatively by calling the function \urlout{Event-Recorder-Initialize-Func} in the application code.
3. \ref usbHostEvrConfig "Event Recorder Configuration": if necessary, adjust default Event Recorder configuration.
4. Build the application code, download it to the target hardware and start debug session.

Now, when the USB Host generates event information, it can be viewed in the \urlout{uv4-Event-Recorder}.

#### Event Recorder Configuration {#usbHostEvrConfig}

This section describes the configuration settings for the Event Recorder; refer to \urlout{RTX5-Event-Recorder-Config} for more information.

**USB Event Generation Configuration**

Selecting the **USB:CORE** will add the file `USB_Debug.h` to your project. Use this file to set the event
generation configuration for USB core, drivers, and device classes separately. The file is common for USB Device and Host components.

![USB_Debug.h file for event generation configuration](USBH_USB_Debug_h.png)

The following settings are available for event generation configuration of each module:

- **Off** means no events will be generated by the module
- **Errors** means only error events will be generated by the module
- **Errors + API** means error and API call events will be generated by the module
- **All** means all available events will be generated by the module. Besides error and API call events, this contains operation and detailed events.

#### Event IDs

The USB Host component uses the following event IDs:

| Component   | Event ID |
|-------------|----------|
| USBH_Core   | 0xB0     |
| USBH_Driver | 0xB1     |
| USBH_CC     | 0xB2     |
| USBH_CDC    | 0xB3     |
| USBH_HID    | 0xB4     |
| USBH_MSC    | 0xB5     |

## Examples {#USB_Host_Tutorial}

MDK Professional contains multiple example projects that show how to implement an USB Host. The following examples are
available for most of the development boards:

- The \ref host_hid_tutorial example shows how to interact with an USB keyboard from a microcontroller.
- The \ref host_msc_tutorial example shows how to access an USB memory stick from a microcontroller.
- The \ref host_cdc_tutorial example shows how to communicate with an USB CDC Device from a microcontroller.
- The \ref host_cust_tutorial example shows how to communicate with any USB Device from a microcontroller.
  Here, it will be demonstrated using a USB to serial RS232 adapter with
  [Prolific PL2303](https://www.prolific.com.tw/US/index.aspx) UART-to-USB bridge chip.

To use these examples, use the \urlout{uv4_ca_packinstaller}, select the related **Board** and **Copy** the example.

### USB Host Keyboard {#host_hid_tutorial}

The following example application shows how to interact with a **USB keyboard** from a microcontroller.
To keep it simple, the graphical LCD on the evaluation board is used to show the keyboard inputs. This is done using
the **Compiler** software component with the appropriate user code templates.

![USB host keyboard example hardware setup](usbh_hid_setup.png)

The `Abstract.txt` file contained in the **Documentation** group of the **Project** window gives you more information on the
general setup and the available I/O of the development board.

#### Build the "USB Host Keyboard" Project

Open the example project in MDK (\urlout{uv4_ca_packinstaller} web page explains this).

##### Source Files

- `Keyboard.c` contains the main C function that initializes the board hardware and the USB Host Component. It also reads
  the input from the attached keyboard.
- In `stdout_display.c`, the function `stdout_putchar` is retargeted to the function `GLCD_DrawChar` of the graphics
  display.

If you are using RTOS other than CMSIS-RTOS2 RTX5 for your project please make sure to satisfy \ref usbh_res_req.

You may now build and download the example project to the evaluation board using the µVision commands:

- **Project** --> **Build target (F7)**
- **Flash** --> **Download (F8)**
- **Debug** --> **Start/Stop Debug Session (Ctrl + F5)**
- **Debug** --> **Run (F5)**

After these steps, the project should start executing on your evaluation kit.
In case of errors, refer to the Evaluation Board User's Guide for configuration information.

#### Using the "USB Host Keyboard" Project

##### Hardware Setup

The setup of the Evaluation Board hardware is described in the `Abstract.txt` file.

- Verify all jumper settings on the target hardware.
- Connect a USB keyboard to one of the development board's USB connectors.

![USB host keyboard example output](usbh_keyboard_glcd.png)

### USB Host Mass Storage {#host_msc_tutorial}

The following example application shows how to access an **USB memory stick** from a microcontroller.
This example will create or overwrite a file called `Test.txt` on the USB Stick with the content "USB Host Mass Storage!".
The following picture shows an exemplary connection of the development board and an USB memory stick.

![USB host mass storage example hardware setup](usbh_msc_setup.png)

The `Abstract.txt` file contained in the **Documentation** group of the **Project** window gives you more information on the
general setup and the available I/O of the development board.

#### Build the "USB Host Mass Storage" Project

Open the example project in MDK (the \urlout{uv4_ca_packinstaller} web page explains this).

##### Source Files

- `MassStorage.c` contains the main C function that initializes the board hardware, the flash storage device and the USB
  Host Component. Also, it contains that code that will write a file with a message onto the attached USB stick.

If you are using RTOS other than CMSIS-RTOS2 RTX5 for your project please make sure to satisfy \ref usbh_res_req.

You may now build and download the example project to the evaluation board using the µVision commands:

- **Project** --> **Build target (F7)**
- **Flash** --> **Download (F8)**
- **Debug** --> **Start/Stop Debug Session (Ctrl + F5)**
- **Debug** --> **Run (F5)**

After these steps, the project should start executing on your evaluation kit.
In case of errors, refer to the Evaluation Board User's Guide for configuration information.

#### Using the "USB Host Mass Storage" Project

##### Hardware Setup

The setup of the Evaluation Board hardware is described in the `Abstract.txt` file.

- Verify all jumper settings on the target hardware.
- Simply connect an USB memory stick to one of the development board's USB connectors and run the program.
- Detach the USB memory stick and attach it to a PC to check the availability of the `Test.txt` file.

### USB Host Custom Class {#host_cust_tutorial}

This example application shows how to communicate with serial RS232 adapter with
[Prolific PL2303](https://www.prolific.com.tw/US/index.aspx)
UART-to-USB bridge chip from a microcontroller. It is a simple demonstration
on how to send data from the USB Host via the USB to serial RS232 adapter to an attached serial terminal. Here, the USB Host sends "Test!" to the
USB to serial RS232 adapter and stores all incoming data from the device into the array `receive_buf`. This example is using the Custom
Class because the PL2303 is not USB CDC ACM compliant.

The following picture shows an exemplary connection of the development board and an PL2303 based Device. The PL2303 Device is
connected to a PC via RS232 to check incoming messages.

![USB host custom class example hardware setup](usbh_cust_pl2303_example_setup.png)

#### Create the "USB Host Custom Class PL2303" Project

In this example, we are using the [MCBSTM32F400](https://www.keil.arm.com/boards/keil-mcbstm32f400-ver-12-3cd831d/projects/)
board with the STM32F407IGHx device. Create a new project in MDK
(Select Device **STMicroelectronics:STM32F4 Series: STM32F407:STM32F407IG:STM32F407IGHx**).
In the **Manage Run-Time Environment** window, select the following components:

- **Board Support:LED (API):LED** (Variant **MCBSTM32F400**)
- **CMSIS:Core**
- **CMSIS:RTOS2 (API):Keil RTX5**
- **CMSIS Driver:USART (API):PL2303**
- **CMSIS Driver:USB Host (API):Full-speed**
- **Device:STM32Cube Framework (API):Classic**
- **USB** (Variant **MDK**)
- **USB:Host: 1**
- **USB:Host:Custom Class**

Click the **Resolve** button and then **OK**.

Before continuing to add the required source code, you need to add a template file called `USBH_PL2303.c`:

- Right-click on **Source Group 1** and select **Add New Item to Group 'Source Group 1'...**.
- Click on **User Code Template** and scroll down on  the left side, until you see the **USB** component template files.
- Choose **USB Host Prolific 2303**
- Click on **Add**.

Before building the project, you need to edit these configuration files (in Configuration Wizard view):

- Under **Device**, double-click **RTE_Device.h** and:
  - enable **USB OTG Full-speed** and under it:
    - enable **Host [Driver_USBH0]**
    - disable **Host [Driver_USBH0]:Overcurrent Detection Pin**

- Double-click **USB:USBH_Config_0.h** and under **USB Host 0** change:
  - set **Maximum Pipes in system** to **4**

Before building and downloading the project to the target, make sure that the correct debugger is set in the **Options for
Target** dialog (ALT + F7). You may then build and download the example project to the evaluation board using the µVision
commands:

- **Project** --> **Build target (F7)**
- **Flash** --> **Download (F8)**
- **Debug** --> **Start/Stop Debug Session (Ctrl + F5)**
- **Debug** --> **Run (F5)**

After these steps, the project should start executing on your evaluation kit.
In case of errors, refer to the Evaluation Board User's Guide for configuration information.

#### Using the "USB Host Custom Class PL2303" Project

##### Hardware Setup

- Verify all jumper settings on the target hardware.
- Connect an USB to serial  RS232 adapter using the Prolific PL2303 to the development board's **USBFS** connector.
- Connect the serial line to a PC and open a terminal using 115200 baud data rate.
- You should see the message "Test!" in the terminal window. You can also send messages from the PC to the microcontroller
  device. For that, please check the `receive_buf` buffer called by the `->Receive` function.

### USB Host CDC ACM {#host_cdc_tutorial}

This example application shows how to communicate with an **USB CDC ACM Device** from a microcontroller. It is a simple demonstration
on how to send data from the USB Host to the attached USB CDC ACM Device. Here, the USB Host sends "Test!" to the USB CDC ACM Device
and stores all incoming data from the device into the array `receive_buf`.

The following picture shows an exemplary connection of the development board and an USB CDC ACM Device implemented on another
development board. This USB CDC ACM Device is connected to a PC via RS232 to check incoming messages.

![USB device audio example hardware setup](usbh_cdc_example_setup.png)

#### Create the "USB Host CDC" Project

In this example, we are using the [MCBSTM32F400](https://www.keil.arm.com/boards/keil-mcbstm32f400-ver-12-3cd831d/projects/)\
board with the STM32F407IGHx device.
Create a new project in MDK (Select Device **STMicroelectronics:STM32F4 Series: STM32F407:STM32F407IG:STM32F407IGHx**).
In the **Manage Run-Time Environment** window, select the following components:

- **Board Support:LED (API):LED** (Variant **MCBSTM32F400**)
- **CMSIS:Core**
- **CMSIS:RTOS2 (API):Keil RTX5**
- **CMSIS Driver:USART (API):CDC**
- **CMSIS Driver:USB Host (API):Full-speed**
- **Device:STM32Cube Framework (API):Classic**
- **USB** (Variant **MDK**)
- **USB:Host: 1**
- **USB:Host:CDC**

Click the **Resolve** button and then **OK**.
