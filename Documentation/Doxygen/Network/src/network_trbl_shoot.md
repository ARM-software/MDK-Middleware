# Troubleshooting a Network Application {#network_troubleshoot}

## Network library hierarchy {#trbl_nw_hierachry}

**BSD sockets** represent the Session layer in the OSI model.
They are using the native TCP and UDP sockets of the Network library. The debug messages from the BSD module are very compact
and provide as less information as possible. You can see how the BSD functions are called and their return values. Most of
the time this is sufficient. If not, enable the underlying layers as well.

**TCP, UDP sockets** implement the TCP/UDP protocol, which is then used by BSD sockets. Their debug messages show the
details of the TCP/UDP protocol in the communication stream. Information about error recovery, flow control and
re-transmissions is displayed. In case the BSD socket communication fails, this can point to the underlying problem.

The **IPv4, IPv6 network layer** adds the concept of routing above the Data Link Layer. When data arrives at the network
layer, the source and destination addresses are examined to determine if the data has reached the final destination. If this
is true, the data is formatted into packets and delivered up to the TCP/UDP layer. The IP layer debug messages show details
about IP addresses, routing and packet fragmentation and reassembly (if this is used in communication).

On the **Ethernet, WiFi, PPP and SLIP layer**, bits are packed into data frames and physical addressing is managed (for example
using MAC addresses).

## Best practices {#trbl_bestpractice}

This section shows some of the best practices that are used by the developers of the network stack when troubleshooting
communication issues. Following them should usually quickly help identifying the underlying problem of a non-working project.

\note
The following assumes that you are using \ref netEvrSupport "Event Recorder" based debugging.

### Check the Ethernet interface {#trbl_verify_eth}

\urlout{CMSIS-View} shows you static information about the operation of a software component. In the ÂµVision
debugger, go to **Debug -> View -> Watch windows -> Network** to see the status information of the network library:

![Component Viewer for the Network library](trbl_cv_nw.png)

This indicates the following:

| Property | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| ETH interface | Shows physical connection problems; Link-Up indicates a stable connection |
| IP Address| Shows DHCP address assignment problems; for an unassigned IP address the entry reads 0.0.0.0 |

The Ethernet interface is operational when the link-up state is indicated and a DHCP address is assigned. When using a static
IP address, DHCP assignment is skipped. Thus, only the link-up state is required.

If the DHCP client is enabled, but fails to receive an IP address from the DHCP server, use DHCP events to follow the DHCP
assignment process and possibly identify the root-cause of the problem. Usually, DHCP assignment fails when the DHCP server
is not available or is not operational in the local network.

### Verify Socket Communication {#trbl_verify_sock}

Event Recorder shows the sequence of events for the connection. The following example shows the BSD event log of a successful
communication:

```txt
10  13.11487039  NetBSD  SocketAllocated      sock=1  type=SOCK_STREAM
11  13.11487544  NetBSD  ConnectSocket        sock=1
12  13.14889442  NetBSD  CbfuncTcpEvent       sock=1  event=Established
13  13.14891358  NetBSD  ConnectStreamSuccess sock=1
14  18.14885683  NetBSD  Closesocket          sock=1
```

When the BSD socket is connected, the state of the underlying TCP socket is shown in the viewer as well:

![TCP sockets in Component Viewer](trbl_cv_nw_tcp.png)

This shows the remote IP address and port number, as well as the local port number, the value for the timeout timer and the
active TCP socket options. This is valuable information in addition to the events shown in Event Recorder.

The following example shows the BSD event log in case a target cannot be reached:

```txt
3   7.41687549   NetBSD  SocketAllocated      sock=1  type=SOCK_STREAM
4   7.41688068   NetBSD  ConnectSocket        sock=1
5   22.41490458  NetBSD  CbfuncTcpEvent       sock=1  event=Aborted
6   22.41491838  NetBSD  ConnectStreamTimeout sock=1
7   27.41486937  NetBSD  Closesocket          sock=1
```

After a timeout, BSD connect fails with the log "ConnectStreamTimeout". From the timestamp records, you can observe that this
happened 15 seconds later. During this time, a TCP module has made several retries to establish a connection with the remote
host, but finally gave up.

Possible reasons for the connection to fail:

-# a remote host is not reachable (either not running or switched off).
-# a firewall blocks the outbound connection.
-# a firewall blocks the inbound connection.
-# a local port number used for communication is reserved for other means in the communication equipment (ie. modem/router).
   For example, the TCP port 49152 is sometimes reserved by the Internet provider for remote management of the communication
   device. In general, communication using reserved ports is not possible.

After a BSD connect() is called and before the function completes, many events are generated from the TCP socket, indicating
how the TCP is performing the connect. Here is a log of successful connect with BSD and TCP events enabled:

```txt
6   13.41688149  NetBSD  ConnectSocket        sock=1

24  13.45966893  NetBSD  ConnectStreamSuccess sock=1
```

To trace all events that are relevant for the BSD connect, also enable IPv4 and ETH events. In this case, the number of
generated events is much larger. Tracking the Event Recorder log becomes more difficult:

```

This is what happens when the BSD connect() function is called:

-# The TCP connect process is started.
-# The current local port is \token{0}. The system allocates port 49152 from the dynamic ports range for the local port.
-# The TCP layer creates a TCP header and sends the control frame with a SYN flag set to the IPv4 network.
-# The IPv4 network adds the IPv4 header with the source and destination IP address and sends the frame to the ETH interface.
-# The ETH interface checks the ARP cache if the destination IP address 64.233.184.206 has already been resolved, (the target
   IP address is not local, so the gateway is selected to forward the packet to).
-# The MAC address of a gateway is resolved and the Ethernet frame is sent to the gateway.
-# After a small delay, an Ethernet frame is received from the gateway (MAC=C0-A0-BB-77-4F-B8).
-# The IPv4 network shows that it is originating from IP address 64.233.184.206; protocol is TCP.
-# TCP shows the TCP header information and maps this frame to the existing TCP socket 1.
-# As the control frame has the SYN+ACK flags set, TCP generates an ACK response and transits to ESTABLISHED state.
-# The outgoing TCP ACK frame traverses IPv4 and ETH layers and is sent to the gateway.
-# TCP also generates an event for the BSD socket 1, which is blocked and waiting to resume.
-# BSD socket 1 resumes with an event "ConnectStreamSuccess" (this signals that the BSD socket 1 is now connected).

### Verify Secure Communication {#trbl_verify_secure}

If the BSD socket has connected successfully to the IoT Cloud, but the TLS handshake has failed, no secure connection will be
established. An established network connection is indicated with the NetBSD event "ConnectStreamSuccess" in the Event
Recorder log.

Usually, \ref use_mbed_tls "Mbed TLS" is used as the security layer for MDK-Middleware. To successfully debug the Mbed TLS
security layer, read the related MbedTLS documentation.

Typical errors in the security layer are:

- heap size too small and Mbed TLS cannot allocate enough memory for the requested operation.
- thread stack size of the thread running Mbed TLS is too small and thus stack overflows are detected. This leads to
  sporadic crashes of the IoT application.
- invalid credentials or security certificates are used so that the certificate verification fails during the TLS handshake.
