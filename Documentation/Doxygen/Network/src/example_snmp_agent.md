# SNMP Agent {#SNMP_Agent_Example}

This example shows how to use SNMP to control an embedded system.

The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is mainly used in network management systems to monitor network-attached devices for conditions that warrant administrative attention. It is the most popular network management protocol in the TCP/IP protocol suite.

The following picture shows an exemplary connection of the development board and a Computer.

## Project Organization

The SNMP Agent project is available as part of the \ref nw_ref_example "Network Reference Example".

<h2>Application Source Files</h2>

Following files implement application-specific logic in the example:

 - `SNMP_Agent.c` contains the main C function that initializes the board hardware and the Network Component. 
 - `SNMP_Agent_MIB.c` contains the \ref mib_data_table. Change this to the application's needs.

<h2>Software Components Configuration Files</h2>

Configuration files for the software components used in the project are available in the `/RTE/` directory and can be modified to adjust the operation of related components. Section TBD gives an overview about the components and their dependencies.

Following configuration files are provided with this example:

 - For the Network component, in `/RTE/Network/` folder:
   - `Net_Config_SNMP_Agent.h`: \ref using_snmp_agent_conf "SNMP Agent configuration".
   - `Net_Config_UDP.h`: \ref using_network_sockets_udp_conf "UDP Socket configuration".
   - `Net_Config_ETH_0.h`: \ref using_ethernet_interfaces_conf "Ethernet Interface configuration".
   - `Net_Config.h`: \ref nw_Network_Core "Network Core configuration".
   - `Net_Debug.h`: \ref netDebugConfig "Network Debug configuration".
 - For the CMSIS components, in the `/RTE/CMSIS/` folder:
   - `RTX_Config.h` and `RTX_Config.h`: [CMSIS-RTX Configuration files](https://arm-software.github.io/CMSIS-RTX/latest/config_rtx5.html) for the RTOS Kernel.

When a board layer is added to the project, corresponding configuration files for the board and device components will become available in the local `/Board/` directory.

<h2>Board Layer</h2>

In order to build the SNMP Agent project it shall be extended with a compatible board layer that provides following interfaces as [connections](https://github.com/Open-CMSIS-Pack/cmsis-toolbox/blob/main/docs/ReferenceApplications.md#connections):
 - `CMSIS_ETH`: CMSIS-Driver for Ethernet interface
 - `CMSIS_VIO`: CMSIS-Driver for virtual I/O interface
 - `STDOUT`: Standard Output redirection

## Build the Project

[Working with MDK-Middleware Examples](../General/working_with_examples.html) explains the workflow for accessing, configuring and building an MDK-Middleware example project for your target hardware.

 -# Open the **Network** MDK-Middleware reference example.
 -# Make sure the compatible board layer is configured.
 -# Select **SNMP_Agent** as an active project for the build process.
 -# Build the project and observe that no errors are reported.

## Run the Example

**Hardware Setup**

Board-specific setup such as jumpers, Ethernet ports, power supply, etc. is documented in the board layer description (`README.md`) of your selected target.

 -# Load the firmware image to the target development board.
 -# Use an Ethernet cable to connect your development board to the local area network. The PC is assumed to be already in this LAN.

**Example execution**

To test this example, run the Windows application *SNMPTest.exe* that is available as part of [Keil MDK uVision](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/101407/latest/About-uVision/Installation) and is located in `<install_dir>\ARM\Utilities\SNMPTest\Release\` folder, where `<install_dir>` refers to the Keil MDK uVision installation directory. The program runs stand-alone without installation.

Type in the IP address of your Embedded SNMP Agent and click *Connect*. When connected, you can change the LCD text on the target, control the on-board LED diodes and monitor the state of on-board push-buttons.
