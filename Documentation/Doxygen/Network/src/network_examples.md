and a Computer.

![HTTP server hardware setup](cws_setup.png)

The `README.md` file contained in the Documentation group of the Project window gives you more information on the general
setup and the available I/O of the development board.

### Build the "HTTP Server" Project

Open the example project in MDK (the \urlout{uv4_ca_packinstaller} web page explains how to do this).

#### Source Files

- `HTTP_Server.c` contains the main C function that initializes the board hardware and the Network Component.
- The `HTTP_Server_CGI.c` defines the functions for the scripting language for communication with the hardware.
- `Web.c` is a compiled file that will be generated by the \urlout{uv4_ut_fcarmuv} tool from all the web input files.
- The **Web files** group contains all the HTML and CGI files that will be compiled into the `Web.c` file. The files
  in this group determine the actual layout of the web page and the behaviour of the different refs using CGI.
- A `HTTP_Server_Multiuser.c` file can be added using the \urlout{uv4_ca_sourcefiles} feature.
  This file is used for specifying multiple users and access rights for these users.
- Adding the `HTTP_Server_Access.c` file enables the server to accept or block connection requests from certain remote
  clients.
- The user code template file `HTTP_Server_Error.c` contains the information that the web server is showing in case of
  errors (such as Error 404).

You may now build and download the example project to the evaluation board.

After these steps, the project should start executing on your evaluation kit.
In case of errors, refer to the Evaluation Board User's Guide for configuration information.
If you want to know how the file converter works that is required to compile the web pages into a single C file, please
