The File System Component is used in many different applications and examples. One stand-alone example is available to demonstrate
the usage of the File System. Other examples use the File System Component in conjunction with other Components (such as USB or
Network for example).

- \subpage File_Demo_Example shows the basic functionality of the File System.
- [USB Device Mass Storage](../USB/usbd_example_msc.html) shows how to create an USB MSC Device that is recognized by an USB Host controller.
- [USB Host Mass Storage](../USB/usbh_example_msc.html) explains how to access file system data from an attached USB memory device.
- [FTP Server](../Network/FTP_Server_Example.html) accesses the device's file system via a network connection.
