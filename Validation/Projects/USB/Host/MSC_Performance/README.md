# MDK-Middleware Validation

## USB Host - Mass Storage Class (MSC) device Performance Measurement project

These tests are used to test **speed** of **write** and **read** operations from **USB Host Component** to the **USB Flash Drive** (USB memory stick).

To execute the performance tests **connect a USB Flash Drive** to the **USB Host port instead of connecting two USB ports together**.

Follow the other steps as documented in the documentation [documentation](../../../../README.md#build-the-validation-project).

> Note: This project is commented-out in the **USB_Host.csolution.yml**, uncomment it to enable it!
