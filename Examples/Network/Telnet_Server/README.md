Telnet Server Example
===========

This MDK-Middleware example project implements a **Telnet Server** example. It shows you how to set up a command line 
interface within an embedded application.

For detailed description see [Telnet Server Example section in MDK-Middleware documenation](https://arm-software.github.io/MDK-Middleware/latest/Network/Telnet_Server_Example.html).

Key usage aspects
-----

For successful build and operation the project needs to be extended with a board layer that implements required [connections](https://github.com/Open-CMSIS-Pack/cmsis-toolbox/blob/main/docs/ReferenceApplications.md#connections) to the target hardware intefaces. For details see example documentation referenced above.


To use this example, connect an evaluation board to a LAN with a router. You can also connect an evaluation board directly to a PC using a direct or crossover network cable.

To run the program, start a Telnet client (for example PuTTY) on your PC connected to the same LAN. Use following parameters as default to establish a Telnet connection:

 - Host name:  `my_host`
 - Telnet port: 23
 - user: admin
 - password: \<none\>

Type *help* to see the available commands or *bye* to close the connection.
