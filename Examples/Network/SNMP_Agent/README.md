This program is an **SNMP Agent** example. It shows how to use a Simple Network
Management Protocol is used to control the embedded system.

Use this example to connect an evaluation board to a LAN with a DHCP server
(most LANs have one). This example automatically configures the network parameters
via a DHCP protocol.

To test this example, run the Windows application *SNMPTest.exe* on your PC.
Enter the IP address of your embedded SNMP_Agent and click on 'Connect'. Once
the connection is established, you can change the LCD text on the target device,
control the built-in LED diodes and monitor the status of the built-in push-buttons.
