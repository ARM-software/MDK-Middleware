# MDK-Middleware Examples

These MDK-Middleware examples demonstrate how to use MDK-Middleware software components in various application scenarios.

The examples are implemented as [CMSIS-Toolbox Reference Applications](https://open-cmsis-pack.github.io/cmsis-toolbox/ReferenceApplications/) that are hardware agnostic and require a board layer with drivers for the specific target hardware.

For details see [Working with MDK-Middleware examples](https://arm-software.github.io/MDK-Middleware/latest/General/working_with_examples.html) in MDK-Middleware documentation.
