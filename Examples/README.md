# MDK-Middleware Examples

These MDK-Middlware examples demonstrate how to use MDK-Middleware software components in various application scenarios.

The examples are implemented as [CMSIS-Toolbox Referernce Applications](https://github.com/Open-CMSIS-Pack/cmsis-toolbox/blob/main/docs/ReferenceApplications.md) that are hardware agnostic and require a board layer with drivers for the specific target hardware.

For details see [Working with MDK-Middleware examples](https://arm-software.github.io/MDK-Middleware/latest/General/working_with_examples.html) in MDK-Middleware documentation.
